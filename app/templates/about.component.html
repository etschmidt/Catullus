			<p>This site is a repository of the poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus. The Latin text is the E. T. Merrill 1893 edition and commentary and is provided by Perseus Digital Library, with funding from The National Endowment for the Humanities. Original version available for viewing and download <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0003">here</a> and in the source files of this website at the GitHub link below. However, the scanned notes are taken from the R. A. B. Mynors 1953 edition from the Oxford University Press, which has been out of print for many decades, although it can be found in libraries such as <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10354897?q&versionId=12052936">these</a> all around the world. The notes are mine, from <a href="http://www.jcmckeown.com/contact.php">J. C. McKeown's</a> Latin 519 - Poetry of Catullus course at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The English translations are from A. S. Kline's <a href="http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Catullus.htm">2001 repository</a></p>
