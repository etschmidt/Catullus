            <title type="sub">CATULLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A MEAGRE array of facts more or less controverted, and a few critical <br>
            remarks, are all we can offer towards a biography of Valerius Catullus. <br>
            We learn from the testimony of many ancient writers, that he was a na­ <br>
            tive of Verona or its immediate neighbourhood; and the Marquis Scipiu <br>
            Maffei, himself a Veronese, asserts that in his day there were still traits <br>
            of the language of Catullus in the dialect of his countrymen. Whether <br>
            the poet's prænomen was Caius or Quintus is uncertain, the former being <br>
            assigned to him by Apuleius, the latter by Pliny. A more important ques­ <br>
            tion is that which concerns the dates of his birth and death. According <br>
            to Hieronymus, in the Eusebian chronicle, he was born B. c. 87, and died <br>
            in his thirtieth year, B. C. 57. The second date is undoubtedly erroneous, <br>
            for we have positive evidence from his own works that he was alive in the <br>
            consulship of Vatinius, B. c. 47. It is evident too that he must have sur­ <br>
            vived at least till B. c. 45, for Cicero, in his Letters, talks of the verses of <br>
            Catullus against Cæsar and Mamurra (xxix.) as newly written, and first <br>
            seen by Cæsar in that year. The chronologer's mistake as to the time <br>
            of the poet's death, throws some doubt also on that which he assigns to <br>
            his birth. We shall however be exact enough for all literary purposes, if <br>
            we conclude with Dunlop that Catullus " was nearly contemporary with <br>
            Lucretius, having come into the world a few years after him, and having <br>
            survived him but a short period."</p>
          <p>It is not certain that the poet belonged to the patrician family of the <br>
            Valerii, but his father must have been a person of some consideration, for <br>
            he was the friend and habitual entertainer of Julius Cæsar. The son took <br>
            up his abode in Rome in the very spring of youth (LXVIII. 15) and plunged <br>
            without restraint into all the expensive pleasures of the best-that is to <br>
            say, the most debauched-society. This is sufficient to account for the <br>
            jocular complaints of poverty interspersed through his writings. It is <br>
            easy to conceive that one whose only business was to enjoy life in an age <br>
            and in a city of unbounded luxury, and who was a liberal purchaser of <br>
            such commodities as were dealt in by the worthy Silo (ciii.), should have <br>
            been often " hard up''. for cash; and that he should have had occasion for <br>
            frequent intercourse with lawyers and orators, such as Alphenus Varus <note type="footnote"> A </note> <br>
             <pb n="2"/>
            Licinius Calvus, and M. Tullius Cicero. Yet his fortune was by no means <br>
            small, for he possessed a noble villa on the beautiful promontory of Sir­ <br>
            mio, another near Tibur, and he made a voyage from the Pontus in his <br>
            own yacht. To improve his pecuniary circumstances, he adopted the <br>
            usual Roman expedient for quickly filling a lank purse, and accompanied <br>
            Caius Memmius, the celebrated patron of Lucretius, to Bithynia, when <br>
            he was appointed Prætor of that province. But it is plain from his direct <br>
            testimony, as well as from the bitterness of his invectives against his chief, <br>
            that he derived little profit from that expedition.</p>
          <p>Catullus repeatedly deplores with every mark of heartfelt grief the loss <br>
            of a brother who died in the Troad. This event is generally supposed to <br>
            have happened whilst the poet was in Bithynia; but, as Professor Ramsay <br>
            has well remarked, " any evidence we possess leads to a different conclu­ <br>
            sion. When railing against the evil fortune which attended the journey <br>
            to the East, he makes no allusion to any such misfortune as this; we <br>
            find no notice of the event in the pieces written immediately before quit­ <br>
            ting Asia and immediately after his return to Italy; nor does the language <br>
            of those passages in which he gives vent to his sorrow, in any way con­ <br>
            firm the conjecture."</p>
          <p>Gifted with a fine person, a vigorous constitution, and rare genius, Ca­ <br>
            tullus was meant by nature for better things: it was the curse of his times <br>
            that made him an idler and a voluptuary : <br>
            O blame not the bard if he fly to the bowers <br>
            Where Pleasure sits carelessly smiling at Fame ; <br>
            He was born for much more, and in happier hours <br>
            His soul might have glowed with a holier flame.</p>
          <p>That he was not indifferent to public wrongs is proved by the vehe­ <br>
            mence with which he assailed Cæsar in the plenitude of his power. A <br>
            man of fine sensibility and delicate fancy, he was no less remarkable <br>
            for the strength and depth of his feelings. Regarded as indications of <br>
            character, his poems to Lesbia are unique in Roman literature for the <br>
            intensity and self-oblivion of the passion they portray. Some of theIr <br>
            breathe the delicious frenzy of desire; or the sweet sadness that evei <br>
            mingles with the best of joy, and is so like it that we scarce know <br>
            whether to call it pain or pleasure ; the rest are heavy with the grief for <br>
            which there is no cure, the anguish of a heart that dotes, yet more than <br>
            doubts; that cannot cease to love what it loathes and scorns.</p>
          <p>Clodia, as we learn from Apuleius, was the real name of Lesbia, " but <br>
            this bare fact"—we again quote Ramsay—"by no means entitles us to <br>
            jump to the conclusion at which many have arrived, that she was the <br>
            sister of the celebrated Clodius slain by Milo. Indeed the presumption <br>
            is strong against such an inference. The tribute of high-flown praise paid <br>
            to Cicero would have been but a bad recommendation to the favour of <br>
            one whom the orator makes the subject of scurrilous jests, and who is <br>
            said to have cherished against him all the vindictive animosity of a woman <br>
            first slighted, and then openly insulted." Of other women with whom <br>
            he may have amused himself, Catullus names only Hypsithilla and Aufi­ <br>
            lina, ladies of Verona; but the language in which he writes of them de­ <br>
            notes an intercourse in which the senses were vividly interested, the affec­ <br>
            tions not at all. Some of his poems are hideous from the traces of a <br>
             <pb n="3"/>
            turpitude to which we cannot without a painful effort make even a passing <br>
            allusion. But so are portions of almost every Roman poet; and amidst <br>
            our natural disgust at these abominations, and at the filthy ribaldry of <br>
            many of the short pieces of Catullus, it is right to remember that these <br>
            things were the vices of the age rather than of the individual. " The <br>
            filth of Catullus seldom springs from a prurient imagination revelling in <br>
            voluptuous images ; it rather proceeds from habitual impurity of expres­ <br>
            sion, and probably gives a fair representation of the manners and con­ <br>
            versation of the gay society of Rome at that period."</p>
          <p>In the contents of a very small book, Catullus has given proof of ex­ <br>
            traordinary versatility, and consummate skill in the most dissimilar <br>
            moods of his art. His compass is a wide one, and he is master of all <br>
            within it. His peculiar characteristics are neatness, racy simplicity <br>
            graceful turns of thought, and exquisite happiness of expression. In <br>
            these qualities he has never been surpassed;andthey are apparent <br>
            alike in his most playful trifles, and when he ascends to the mountain­ <br>
            heights of passion and imagination. Of him it may be affirmed with ab­ <br>
            solute truth, that he adorned all he touched ; hence the appropriateness <br>
            of the epithet doctus which was bestowed upon him by his poetic brethren, <br>
            not, as many have supposed, because of his proficiency in Greek liter­ <br>
            ature, but because of his mastery in the art he professed. Doctus does <br>
            not always mean book-learned ; it is often used to signify skill in any art <br>
            -as in that of archery for instance, when Tibullus calls Cupid's hands <br>
            doctas, after they had learned the use of the bow. Doctus means " taught," <br>
            and as one who is well taught is accomplished in his speciality, the epithet <br>
            came naturally to bear that secondary signification. That the English <br>
            epithet "learned" is restricted to one particular kind of proficiency, <br>
            is merely the result of arbitrary custom. The wider import of the Latin <br>
            word is better expressed in such obsolete phrases as " cunning of fence," <br>
            " cunning in music, in mathematics," &amp;c. In this sense Horace applies <br>
            it to the great actor Roscius; and in this sense it was applied by courtesy <br>
            to poets in general, and distinctively and emphatically to Catullus.</p>
          <p>Horace unjustly assumes to himself (Epist. 19, lib. i.) the credit of <br>
            having been the first to enrich the literature of his country with imi­ <br>
            tations of the Greek lyric poets; Catullus had preceded him in that field, <br>
            and with the more essential advantage which genius possesses over talent. <br>
            " Catullus," says Dunlop. " translated many of the shorter and more <br>
            delicate pieces of the Greeks; an attempt which hitherto had been thought <br>
            impossible, though the broad humour of their comedies, the vehement <br>
            pathos of their tragedies, and the romantic interest of the Odyssey, had <br>
            stood the transformation. His stay in Bithynia, though little advantageous <br>
            to his fortune, rendered him better acquainted than he might otherwise <br>
            have been with the productions of Greece ; and he was therefore in a <br>
            great degree indebted to this expedition (on which he always appears to <br>
            have looked back with mortification and disappointment) for those felici­ <br>
            tous turns of expression, that grace, simplicity, and purity, which are the <br>
            characteristics of his poems, and of which hitherto Greece alone had af­ <br>
            forded models. Indeed in all his verses, whether elegiac or heroic, we <br>
            perceive his imitation of the Greeks, and it must be admitted that he has <br>
            drawn from them his choicest stores. His Hellenisms are frequent; his <br>
            Images, similes, metaphors, and addresses to himself, are all Greek ; and <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <br>
             <pb n="4"/>
            even in the versification of his odes we see visible traces of their origin. <br>
            Nevertheless he was the inventor of a new species of Latin poetry ; and <br>
            as he was the first who used such variety of measures, and perhaps in­ <br>
            vented some that were new, he was amply entitled to call the poetical <br>
            volume which he presented to Cornelius Nepos Lepidum Novum Libellum. <br>
            The beautiful expressions, too, and idioms of the Greek language, which <br>
            he has so carefully selected, are woven with such art into the texture of <br>
            his composition, and so aptly figure the impassioned ideas of his amorous <br>
            muse, that they have all the fresh and untarnished hues of originality." <br>
            It is certain that some, and probable that many, of the poems of Catul­ <br>
            lus have perished. Pliny makes mention of verses upon love-charms of <br>
            which no trace remains, and Terentianus Maurus mentions some Ithy­ <br>
            phallica. The scholiasts Servius and Nonius refer to passages which are <br>
            not to be found in the existing collection of the works of Catullus. On <br>
            the other hand, the Ciris and the Pervigilium Veneris have been errone­ <br>
            ously ascribed to him. We should have lost him wholly but for the for­ <br>
            tuitous discovery of a single manuscript in bad condition, which was found <br>
            in France in the year 1425. From this source were derived all the MSS. <br>
            on which the old editions were founded, and hence, as might be expected, <br>
            the text is very corrupt, and presents a greater number of various and <br>
            contradictory readings than that of almost any other classic. It is cer­ <br>
            tain too that it has been repeatedly interpolated.</p>
          <p>The present prose translation of Catullus, the first, we believe, that has <br>
            appeared in English, has been framed upon the principle of adhering as <br>
            closely to the letter of the original as is consistent with the genius of the <br>
            respective languages. For a faithful rendering of the letter, prose is the <br>
            best medium; but there its powers end ; for all beyond we must have <br>
            recourse to verse. The poetical versions that follow have been carefully <br>
            selected from many writers, and comprise all the best specimens of their <br>
            kind that have yet been published.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">TIBULLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ALBIUS TIBULLUS (his prænomen is unknown) was a Roman knight, <br>
            contemporary with Horace and Virgil. The date of his birth is uncertain, <br>
            but must be placed somewhere about B. C. 59, the year in which Livy <br>
            came into the world. A spurious distich in the fifth Elegy of book iii. <br>
            was long accepted as proof that Tibullus was born in the same year as <br>
            Ovid, who, on the contrary, invariably speaks of him as a more ancient <br>
            writer and an older man than himself, and particularly in a passage of the <br>
            Tristia, (IV. x.,) in which he fixes the order of succession of the Elegiac <br>
            poets :- <br>
            Virgil I but beheld ; and greedy fate <br>
            Denied Tibullus' friendship, wish'd too late : <br>
            He followed Gallus, next Propertius came ; <br>
            The last was I, the fourth successive name. ELTON.</p><pb n="5"/>
            
          <p>It appears from an epigram of Domitius Marsus, another contempt rary <br>
            of Tibullus, that he died soon after Virgil, that is to say, in or about B. a <br>
            19, while he was yet in the prime of life, or, as the epigram says, while <unclear>lv</unclear> <br>
            was still juvenis, for by that term the Romans meant one who had no­ <br>
            passed his forty-sixth year.</p>
          <p>Te quoque, Virgilio comitem, non æqua, Tibulle, <br>
            Mors juvenem campos misit ad Elysios : <br>
            Ne foret, aut elegis molles qui fleret amores, <br>
            Aut caneret forti regia bella pede. <br>
            Thee, young Tibullus, to th' Elysian plain <br>
            Death bade accompany great Maro's shade ; <br>
            Determined that no poet should remain, <br>
            Or to sing wars, or weep the cruel maid. GRAINGER.</p>
          <p>Tibullus was descended from an ancient and wealthy equestrian family; <br>
            but we learn from himself that he possessed only a small portion of the <br>
            estates of his forefathers. The cause of this decline of fortune has been <br>
            warmly debated among the learned ; some alleging, rightly, as it seems to <br>
            us, that we need not look further for it than to the confiscations of the tri­ <br>
            umviri, in which so many Italian estates were involved; others, that he was <br>
            ruined by his own extravagance. The father of Tibullus had been en­ <br>
            gaged on the side of Pompey in the civil wars, and died soon after Cæsar <br>
            had finally triumphed over the liberties of Rome. It is not to be doubted <br>
            that the patrimony of the son should have been involved in the subsequent <br>
            partition of the lands of Italy ; and though he saved something from the <br>
            wreck, probably through the interest of his patron, Messala, we do not <br>
            find in his Elegies a single expression of gratitude or compliment from <br>
            which it might be conjectured that Augustus had atoned to him for the <br>
            wrongs done by Octavius. It is certainly remarkable, in reference to this <br>
            question, and it raises our respect for the man, that the name of Augustus, <br>
            celebrated with such persevering and fulsome adulation by the other great <br>
            poets of the day, is nowhere to be found in the writings of Tibullus. The <br>
            notion that he wasted his large fortune in dissipation is little more than a <br>
            gratuitous assumption, the only evidence offered in support of it being a <br>
            poetical hyperbole. In the fourth Elegy of the second book he declares <br>
            himself ready to sacrifice all that was left of his hereditary possessions to <br>
            gratify the demands of his covetous mistress : whence some would have <br>
            us infer, that the man who could deliberately talk thus, in a good hex­ <br>
            ameter and pentameter distich, must certainly have made ducks and drakes <br>
            of his property. We rather think that the general tenour of his writings, <br>
            as well as the direct testimony of his friend Horace, leads to the opposite <br>
            conclusion. That discreet Epicurean would not have complimented a <br>
            reckless spendthrift on his knowledge of the art of enjoyment.</p>
          <p>Tibullus acquired at an early period the friendship of his great patron, <br>
            Messala, and retained it to the end of his life. He declined that com­ <br>
            mander's invitation to accompany him in th3 naval war which was des­ <br>
            tined to close with the decisive battle of Actium, doubtless because he <br>
            remained stedfast in his attachment to the cause for which his father had <br>
            Buffered. Immediately after that victory, Messala was detached by Cæsar <br>
            to suppress a formidable insurrection which had broker, out in Aquitaine ; <br>
            and Tibullus accompanied him in the honourable post of contubernalis <br>
             <pb n="6"/>
            corresponding nearly to that of aid-de-camp. Part of the glory of the <br>
            Aquitanian campaign, for which Messala, four years later, obtained a tri­ <br>
            umph, and which Tibullus celebrates in language of unwonted loftiness, <br>
            redounds, according to the poet, to his own fame (book I. vii. 9—11). <br>
            In the following year, (B. c. 30,) Messala was sent to Asia, and again <br>
            Tibullus went with him, but was taken ill and obliged to remain in Cor­ <br>
            cyra, an incident which forms the theme of another beautiful poem <br>
            (book I. iii.).</p>
          <p>After his recovery he seems to have returned home, and to have spent <br>
            the rest of his days, excepting occasional visits to the capital, at his coun­ <br>
            try seat near Pedum, a small town of Latium on the skirts of the Apen­ <br>
            nines, between Præmeste and Tibur. That he lived there in the enjoy­ <br>
            ment of a liberal competence is clear enough, and also that when he speaks <br>
            of his poverty, that term is only to be understood by contrast with the <br>
            overgrown fortunes of many of his noble countrymen. This is apparent <br>
            from many of his own expressions (e. g. book I. i. 5) ; as a Roman knight <br>
            he must have been worth upwards of three thousand pounds; and Horace <br>
            even speaks of him as wealthy. According to him, Tibullus possessed all <br>
            the blessings of life : he was beautiful in person (Horace on this point <br>
            confirms the strong language of the old biographers); he had a competent <br>
            fortune, favour with the great, fame, health ; and knew how to enjoy all <br>
            those blessings. Epist. iv. book i.</p>
          <p>Albius ! the candid critic of my strains, <br>
            What shall I say thou dost on Pedum's plains ? <br>
            Say, dost thou verses write that shall outvie <br>
            Cassius of Parma's darling poesy ? <br>
            Dost thou steal silent through some healthful wood, <br>
            And muse thoughts worthy of the wise and good ? <br>
            Thou wert not born a body void of mind ; <br>
            Yet heaven to thee a graceful form assigned. <br>
            Heaven gave thee riches, and it gave thee more, <br>
            The art to use and to enjoy thy store. <br>
            What beyond this could some fond nurse devise <br>
            To bless her foster-son ? whose thoughts are wise, <br>
            And graced with fluent speech ; whom favours crown <br>
            From the high great, and, from his muse, renown ; <br>
            Abundant health ; a style of life and board <br>
            Genteel with decency, and purse well stored. ELTON.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all his personal and mental graces, and his singularly <br>
            Amiable disposition, Tibullus was not happy in love. The object of that <br>
            attachment, which we have Ovid's authority for considering as his first, is <br>
            celebrated under the poetic name of Delia, a Greek equivalent for ber real <br>
            name, which Apuleius tells us was Plania. It is evident (see book I. vi.) <br>
            that she was not of gentle blood (not ingenua, but libertinæ conditionis). <br>
            She belonged, says Milman, " to that class of females of the middle order, <br>
            not of good family, but above poverty, which answered to the Greek <br>
            hetairai." Tibullus became attached to her before his expedition tu <br>
            Aquitame, and thought of retiring to the country with her as his mistress. <br>
            But Delia was faithless during his absence. On <unclear>us</unclear> return from Corcyra <br>
            he found her ill, and attended her with affectionate solicitude, agai n hoping <br>
             <pb n="7"/>
            to rea. ze his favourite project. But first a richer rival supplanted him ; <br>
            next there appears a husband in the way; and after the seventh Elegy oi <br>
            the first book we hear IN more of Delia. His last love was the mercen­ <br>
            ary Nemesis, tv whom the second book and the last two years of the <br>
            poet's life were devoted, apparently without any return. The third book <br>
            -if this indeed is the composition of Tibullus—is chiefly occupied with <br>
            his unfortunate passion for Neæra. Her, it would appear, he wished to <br>
            marry, he had indeed been actually betrothed to her, but she forsook <br>
            him on the eve of the nuptials. Lastly, there was Glycera, who gave him <br>
            great pain by forsaking him for a younger man, and whom wc have no <br>
            reason for confounding with any of the other three, though she is not <br>
            known to us from his own writings, but only from the Ode in which <br>
            Horace attempts to console him for her inconstancy.</p>
          <p>Tibullus belongs eminently to that class of poets whose works reflect <br>
            the form and colour of their own history. His lot fell upon the evil days <br>
            of his country, in which the remnant of its virtues perished with its rights. <br>
            A long series of civil wars and proscriptions had produced that general <br>
            dissoluteness of manners which invariably attends uncertainty of life and <br>
            property; Eastern conquests had filled Rome with the accumulated wealth, <br>
            and polluted her with the vices, of enslaved nations. Had her freedom <br>
            survived, the old Roman spirit might yet have rallied ; but the one died <br>
            out when the other was crushed under the despotism of Augustus. The <br>
            empire grew in might and majesty ; but its men and women became daily <br>
            viler; and the refinement gained by imitation of foreign examples, though <br>
            in itself a good thing, was a poor exchange for the honour and honesty of <br>
            the rough old republican days; for the racy freshness of home-grown <br>
            habits, thoughts, feelings, and affections ; for every native grace of life, <br>
            lost for ever. Imagine a man like Tibullus cast upon such times as those, <br>
            —a man of instinctive elegance of mind, of extreme sensibility and warm <br>
            affections, more given to contemplation than to action,-and you may go <br>
            near to anticipate much of the general tone of those effusions in which <br>
            his inward nature spontaneously reveals itself. Add to this, that he was <br>
            unhappy in love-how could he have been otherwise ?—less prosperous in <br>
            fortune than in early youth he had reason to expect, a member of a de­ <br>
            feated party, and faithful to the memory of a ruined cause ; and we shall <br>
            more clearly discern the sources of that tender melancholy which is his <br>
            habitual mood, and of those changeful and often impulsive emotions that <br>
            break its even flow, but always subside into it and leave it as before. III <br>
            at ef.se among the realities of the life that surrounded him, he flew to na­ <br>
            ture, the perpetual nurse of wounded spirits, and animating his solitude <br>
            with the traditions of the past, he lived in an ideal world. A relish for <br>
            the delights of the country was a national characteristic of the Romans; <br>
            in him it had the force of a passion. Hence all those exquisite pictures <br>
            of rural scenes and habits, which so strongly impress us with the idea of <br>
            the poet's kindly nature.</p>
          <p>The Latinelegylike the Greek epigram or inscription, had a latitude <br>
            beyond its title. Practically the name implies nothing more definite thai <br>
            a poem not, exceeding a certain length, and written in alternate hexa­ <br>
            meter and pentameter lines. Of that species which turns on love, Tibul­ <br>
            lus is confessedly the master. He is also the most original Latin poet ef <br>
            the A ucustan age, by which we do not mean that he is distinguished for <br>
             <pb n="8"/>
            extraordinary powers of invention, but that he owed nothing to Greek <br>
            models. His subjects, method, diction, and tone, are all his own. His <br>
            thoughts are natural; he abounds with delicate strokes of sentiment and <br>
            expression ; his language is pure from conceit, and his stylethough highly <br>
            finished, has a perfectly easy and flowing simplicity. His range, however, <br>
            as may be supposed from what we have already said, is riot a wide one ; <br>
            and it must be admitted that he recurs to one set of themes and imagery <br>
            with something of a monotonous frequency. But this defect belongs only <br>
            to his elegies taken collectively. Separately, considered, each piece is re­ <br>
            markable for the copious variety of its thoughts and images, as well as for <br>
            the subtlety of the links by which it is made to cohere in the smoothest <br>
            and most unconstrained manner.</p>
          <p>The poems which bear the name of Tibullus are comprised in four bocks. <br>
            The authenticity of the filst two has never been questioned ; but a con­ <br>
            troversy was raised by 1. H. Voss, towards the close of the last century, <br>
            respecting the authorship of the third book, which is addressed to Neæra, <br>
            nominally by one Lygdamus. Who was he ? According to the common <br>
            opinion, he was either a fictitious personage, or, much more probably, Ti­ <br>
            bullus himself under an assumed name. Voss however contended that <br>
            Lygdamus, or whoever wrote under that name, was not Tibullus, but an­ <br>
            other and very inferior poet. This opinion found some adherents in Ger­ <br>
            many ; but Milman, so far as we are aware, is the only scholar of note by <br>
            whom it has been adopted in this country.' Bach, who at one time in­ <br>
            clined to the Vossian theory, has pronounced what we think a sounder <br>
            critical opinion in his edition of 1819. He says it appears that Tibullus <br>
            addressed the book in question to Neæra when he was very young, and <br>
            that this circumstance sufficiently explains the faults here and there ob­ <br>
            servable in a work which bears strong marks of resemblance to the manner <br>
            of Tibullus, and is on the whole not unworthy of his genius. As for the <br>
            fourth book, we see no reason to dissent from the judgment pronounced <br>
            upon it by Milman, in common with many of the best critics. " The hex­ <br>
            ameter poem on Messala," he says, " which opens the fourth book, is so <br>
            bad, that although a successful Elegiac poet may have failed when he at­ <br>
            tempted Epic verse, it cannot well be ascribed to a writer of the exquisite <br>
            taste of Tibullus. The smaller Elegies of the fourth book have all the <br>
            inimitable grace and simplicity of Tibullus. With the exception of the <br>
            thirteenth, (of which some lines are hardly surpassed by Tibullus himself,) <br>
            these poems relate to the love of Sulpicia, a woman of noble birth, for <br>
            Cerinthus, the real or fictitious name of a beautiful youth. Sulpicia <br>
            seems to have belonged to the intimate society of Messala (El. iv. 8). <br>
            Nor is there any improbability in supposing that Tibullus may have writ­ <br>
            ten Elegies in the name or by the desire of Sulpicia. If Sulpicia was her­ <br>
            self the poetess, she approached nearer to Tibullus than any other writer <br>
            of Elegies." <note type="footnote"> 1 Smith'a Diet. of Greek and Horn. Biog. art. Tibullus. </note> <pb n="9"/>

            is spurious, as Handius argues; nor is it likely that Catullus would <br>

            painful smarting of her bosom may be still : to be able to <br>

            Tarn bellum sibi passerem Catulli <br>
            Intra viscera habere coucupiscit. <br>
            " I agree with Sannazarius," says Noel. "Take this piece in its natural <br>
            and obvious sense, and it is a model of grace and good taste : adopt the <br>
            licentious allegory, and nothing can be more forced and frigid." Martial, <br>
            the professed imitator of Catullus, and for that very reason to be dis­ <br>
            trusted as his interpreter, set the first example of this perverse refinement <br>
            oil the simple meaning of the poem. "Kiss me," he says, "and then <br>
            Donabo tibi passerem Catulli, I will give you Catullus's sparrow,"—by <br>
            which he does not mean a poem. Again, in the Apophoreta there is the <br>
            following passage about putting a bird in a cage. <br>
            Si tibi tans erit, qualem dilecta Catullo <br>
            Lesbia ploravit, hîc hahitare potest. <br>
            " If you have such a sparrow as Catullus's Lesbia deplored, it may lodge <br>
            here." Chaulieu has an epigram to the same purport <br>
            Autant et plus que sa vie <br>
            Phyllis aime un passereau; <br>
            Ainsi la jenne Lesbie <br>

            ment ! My girl's sparrow is dead, my girl's pet sparrow, <br>
            which she loved more than her own eyes ; for it was a honeyed <br>
            darling, and knew its mistress as well as my girl herself <br>
            knew her mother; nor did it ever depart from her breast, <br>
            but hopping about now hither, now thither, would chirp ever <br>
            more to its mistress only. Now does it go along the gloomy <br>

            to you ! cruel glooms of Orcus, that devour all fair things ; <br>

          <p>THAT pinnace you see, my friends, avers that it was once <br>
            the swiftest of vessels, and never failed to outstrip the speed <br>
            of any craft that swam, whether the course was to be run <br>
            with oars or canvass. And this, it says, the coast3 of the <br>

            Rhodes, nor rugged Thrace,5 Propontis,6 nor the angry <br>
            Pontic Gulf ; 7 where that pinnace, as it afterwards became, <br>
            was formerly a leafy wood ; for often hath it uttered a rust­ <br>
            ling sound with its vocal foliage on the Cytorian range. <note type="footnote"> Scotland formerly, the lassie who had lost her snood without permission <br>

            Martial in several places. It has been imitated, but far from equalled, <br>
            by Ovid, in his elegy on the death of a parrot, and by Stella, Martial's <br>
            contemporary, in a lost poem on a dove. Noel, the French translator <br>

            dipped its oars in your waters, and bore its master thence <br>
            through so many raging seas, whether the wind piped from <br>
            larboard or from starboard, or whether favouring Joye3 fell <br>
            on both sheets4 together; and that it made no vows under <br>
            distress to the gods of the coast, when it came from the ex­ <br>
            tremity of the sea and reached this limpid lake.5</p>

            she has neither sprightliness nor grace. Surely you love <br>
            some hot-blooded jade or another, and you are ashamed to <br>

            When we came in, various subjects of conversation occurred <br>
            to us: among them, what sort of a country was Bithynia,2 <br>
            what was the state of things there, and how much money had <br>
            I made in it. I answered as was the fact, that neither my­ <br>

            any one of us should show a better scented head3 on his return, <br>

            on his friends, and implies that in so doing he puts their friendship to as <br>
            severe a test as though he asked them to accompany him upon one of <br>
            those formidable journeys he has enumerated. This explanation justifies the <br>
            geographical exordium, which would otherwise seem cold and out of place. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Marrucinus Asinius.] Whether Marrucinus is a name or an epithet, <br>
            and if the latter, what is to be understood by it, are questions much dis­ <br>
            puted. The Marrucini were a people of Campania, situate between the <br>
            Vestini and the Peligini : their chief town was Teate, now Chieti. They <br>
            were distinguished for their fidelity to the Romans; therefore Vulpius <br>
            and Doering suppose the epithet Marrucinian is meant to reproach <br>
            Asinius with his degeneracy from the high character of his countrymen. <br>
            Scaliger says, the Marrucini stood in equal repute with Bœotians for <br>
            stupidity, and accuses Avantius of proposing to read " Inter cœnam,” in­ <br>
            stead of " Marrucine," merely because he was himself a Marrucinian by <br>
            birth, and wished to destroy the record of the hebetude of his countrymen. <br>
            Many conceive that Asinius is merely styled of the country he belonged to, <br>
            without any reproach implied. Lastly, Marrucinus may be a proper name. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Left hand.] Thievish hand is implied. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Pollio.] Supposed to be Asillius Pollio, the poet, orator, and states­ <br>

            detestable words are used here only as coarse forms of threatening, with <br>

            expressed in the words, " the poet who is true to his vocation.” In Poem <br>
            xiv. the epithet impiorum is applied to bad poets. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To be chaste, &amp;c.] Ovid has a distich to the same effect: <br>
            Crede mihi, distant mores a carmine nostri; <br>
            Vita verecunda est, musa jocosa mihi. <br>
            " Believe me there is a wide difference between my morals and my song; <br>
            my life is decorous, my muse is wanton." And Martial says: <br>
            Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba est. <br>
            Which is thus translated by Maynard: <br>
            Si ma plume est une putain, <br>
            Ma vie est une sainte. <br>
            Pliny quotes this poem of Catullus to excuse the wantonness of his <br>
            own verses, which he is sending to his friend Paternus; and Apuleius <br>
            cites the passage in his Apology for the same purpose. " Whoever," says <br>
            Lambe, " would see the subject fully discussed, should turn to the Essay <br>
            on the Literary Character by Mr. Disraeli."' He enumerates as instances <br>
            of free writers who have led pure lives, La Motte le Vayer, Bayle, La <br>
            Fontaine, Smollet, and Cowley. ' The imagination,' he adds, 'may be a <br>
            volcano, while the heart is an Alp of ice.' It would, however, be diffi. <br>
            cult to enlarge this list, while on the other hand the catalogue of those <br>
            who really practised the licentiousness they celebrated, would be very <br>
            numerous. One period alone, the reign of Charles the Second, would <br>
            furnish more than enough to outnumber the above small phalanx of <br>
            purity. Muretus, whose poems clearly gave him every right to know. <br>

            forbidden any credit to accrue to himself from establishing the general <br>
            purity of lascivious poets, at once rejects the probability of such a con. <br>

            the very thing to give them zest and charm, is that they be a <br>

            to Diana, represents her as asking Jove for perpetual chastity and many <br>
            names; attributes which seem rather discordant to us, who are not <br>
            taught to esteem an alias as connected with any virtue. However, <br>
            she thought the distinction of value, for she preserved it more care­ <br>
            fully than Jove's other gift. Minerva is, I believe, of all heathen god­ <br>
            desses, the only one of quite unimpeached chastity, except the Furies. <br>
            This passage, begging Diana to choose the name she liked, was to avoid <br>
            a tedious enumeration ; it was usual in invocations to the deities to call <br>

            Inscriptio is the Latin equivalent for the Greek word epigram. Moreover <br>
            it was customary to display on the fronts of brothels the names of the <br>

            Strabo and Diodorus state positively that the Spaniards were in the <br>
            habit of beautifying their teeth and skin with this singular cosmetic. <br>
            It has been necessary greatly to mitigate the obscene ribaldry of this <br>

            sacrifice of fidelity. There is often an immense difference between the <br>
            conventional and the etymological meaning of words, and a translator <br>
            who regards only the latter must often grossly misrepresent his original. <br>
            A perfectly literal version of this poem would not be more repugnant to <br>

            " If I not love thee, Villiers, more <br>

          <p>But Acme gently bending back her head, and kissing the <br>
            love-drunken eyes of her sweet boy with that rosy mouth of <br>
            hers, said, “My own life, Septimillus, let us ever serve this <br>

            lows one in meagre prose : </note><note type="footnote"> " That man seems to me to be equal to the gods, who sits opposite <br>
            thee, and hearkens to thee near him sweetly speaking and laughing. This <br>
            flutters the heart in my breast; for when I see thee, no voice comes from <br>
            my throat, but my tongue is silent; a subtle fire immediately suffuses <br>
            my skin ; I have no sight in my eyes; my ears boom ; a cold sweat <br>
            overspreads me ; trembling seizes me all over; I am greener than grass, <br>
            and breathless, I seem all but dead." </note><note type="footnote"> The reader will perceive that Catullus has not translated Sappho's <br>
            last stanza, but has substituted for it (or some one else has done so) <br>
            one of a very common-place and inapposite character. It is scarcely <br>
            credible indeed that Catullus can have written such a piece of bathos at <br>
            all; it is more probably the patchwork of some stupid and conceited <br>
            pedant. Three attempts have been made to supply the missing stanza. <br>

            Artubus totis, violamque vincit <br>
            Insidens pallor, moriens nec auras <br>
            Ducere possum. <br>
            Another is by Jans Van der Does or Douza : <br>
            Frigidus sudor fluit; horror artus <br>
            Pallidos herbâ magis it per omnes, <br>
            Et pati mortem videor morans in <br>
            Limine mortis. <br>
            The third is by Henry Stephens : <br>
            Manat et sudor gelidus, tremorque <br>
            Occupat totam ; velut herba pallent <br>
            Ora; sperandi neque compos, orco <br>

            through my limbs ; my ears ring with their own sound ; both <br>

          <p>Ease is baneful to thee, Catullus; thou revellest and de­ <br>

            Dulce loquentem. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Hop-on-a-stool.] The word which contains the point of this epigram <br>
            has been the subject of much debate among the learned. Some read <br>
            solopachium, meaning " a mannikin eighteen inches high;" Saumasius <br>
            proposes salopygium, a “wagtail;” several editors have salaputium, an <br>
            indelicate word nurses used to children when they fondled them, so that <br>
            the exclamation would mean, " what a learned little puppet!" Thus Au­ <br>
            gustus called Horace purissimum penem. The reading to which we have <br>
            adhered is salicippium, implying that little Calvus perched himself upon <br>
            a stool. This reading is confirmed by a passage in Seneca, which men­ <br>
            tions the oration against Vatinius, and particularly records the fact that <br>
            on one occasion at least Calvus imponi se supra cippum jussit, and that <br>

            them, baring her bosom, says, " Lo, here he lies hid in these rosy <br>
            nipples." Now it would be a labour of Hercules to seek you, <br>
            if that be true, for in such a proud lodging as that you are <br>
            sure to be " not at home," my friend. Tell me where you are <br>
            likely to be; out with it boldly, give it to the light of day. <br>
            Do the milk-white girls detain you ? If you keep a close <br>
            tongue, you will throw away all the fruits of love; Venus <br>
            delights in tattling. Or if you will, you may keep your <br>
            mouth shut, provided I have a share in your friendship. <br>

            were mine,-add to these the feather-footed flying sons of <br>
            Boreas, take too the speed of the winds, and though you <br>
            should bestow upon me all these put together, still I should <br>
            be wearied in the marrow of every limb, and eaten up with <br>
            fatigue upon fatigue in hunting after you, my friend.</p>

            of the prevalence and extent of Roman vices, than any other passage in <br>
            the Latin classics. Martial, and Catullus himself elsewhere, have branded <br>
            their enemies; and Juvenal, in bursts of satiric indignation, has re­ <br>
            proached his countrymen with the blackest crimes. But here in a com­ <br>
            plimentary poem to a patron and intimate friend, these are jocularly <br>
            alluded to as the venial indulgence of his earliest youth." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Over the threshold.] The bride entering her husband's house was <br>
            lifted over the threshold, that she might not touch it. Various reasons <br>
            have been assigned for this, among others, that the threshold was sacred <br>
            to Vesta, the goddess of chastity, who might be offended at the nuptials; <br>
            or that the bride should avoid touching any spell which some jealous <br>
            rival might have secretly laid there. Perhaps the true reason is less <br>
            recondite. Cicero speaks of the offensio pedis, (striking the threshold with <br>
            the foot,) generally as an ill omen; and Ovid and Tibullus both mention <br>
            it as to be avoided at the outset of any undertaking. Shakspeare, Henry <br>
            VI., part 3, makes Gloucester say, on finding the gates of York closed <br>
            against him and Edward IV,, <br>
            " The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; <br>
            For many men, that stumble at the threshold, <br>

            conjecture. The " yellow poppy," luteum papaver, suggests to the <br>
            English reader an unfortunate image which was certainly not contem­ <br>
            plated by Catullus. According to Parthenias, the poet's meaning is, that <br>
            the fair complexion of the bride looks as beautiful through her yellow <br>
            marriage veil, as the white blossom of the parthenice does beside the <br>
            yellow poppy. Dr. Nott thinks this interpretation ingenious, but un­ <br>
            sound, for, he says, "When the bride is in bed (uxor in thalamo est) we <br>
            must suppose the flammeum or veil thrown aside: there is then no apt­ <br>
            ness in the comparison, which evidently relates to her blooming counten­ <br>
            ance (os floridulum): I should rather think luteus was meant to express <br>
            a colour bordering on red. We are very ignorant of the true meaning of <br>
            Latin words that have a reference to colours." Admitted : but luteus is <br>
            one of the least ambiguous words of its class, and is decidedly more sug­ <br>
            gestive of jaundice than of the roseate hue of youthful beauty. And <br>
            why must we suppose that the act of removing the bride's veil was not a <br>
            pleasure and a privilege reserved for the bridegroom himself, as is the <br>
            custom among some oriental nations to this day ? In the celebrated <br>
            Aldobrandini fresco-painting, found in the baths of Titus, the bride is <br>
            seated veiled on a bed, with the pronuba or bridesmatron near her, whilst <br>
            the bridegroom sits at the foot of the bed. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <br>

          <p>BORNE over the deep seas in a swift bark, Atys eagerly <br>

            goaded by raging madness, he emasculated himself with a <br>
            sharp flint.</p>

            still spotting the ground with fresh blood, this new-made wo­ <br>

            tubam, without a comma interposed, and understands the passage to <br>
            mean, " the tympanum which serves in lieu of a trumpet in the mys­ <br>

            The goddess who holds the citadels in the high places of <br>

            windy sea with its prow, and the oar-tortured wave grew <br>
            white with foam, wild faces emerged out of the whitening <br>

            on that day, and no other, mortal eyes saw sea-nymphs with <br>
            naked bodies exposed to the breasts from out the hoary wa­ <br>

            leading facts connected with the story of Theseus and Ariadne. The <br>
            Athenians having joined in the murder of Androgeus, son of Minos, king <br>
            of Crete, the latter made war on them, and compelled them to send every <br>
            year to Crete seven youths and as many virgins to be devoured by the <br>
            Minotaur. This monster was the fruit of an unnatural passion which <br>
            Pasiphaë, the daughter of the Sun, and the wife of Minos, had conceived <br>
            for a bull. Daedalus, who had lent his mechanical skill to the fulfilment <br>
            of the queen's desires, built the famous labyrinth to conceal her half­ <br>
            human, half-brute offspring. Theseus, son of Ægeus, king of Athens, <br>
            slew the monster, and made his way out of the labyrinth by means of a <br>
            clue supplied to him by Ariadne, one of the two daughters of Minos and <br>
            Pasiphaë. Theseus then departed for his home, taking with him Ariadne, <br>
            who was accompanied by her sister Phaedra ; but he deserted the former <br>
            at Naxos, and took the latter to Athens as his bride. Catullus, however, <br>
            omits this part of the story, and says expressly that Ariadne left her sister <br>
            behind when she fled from Crete. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Swift ship.] Classis must here stand for a single ship, for a fleet was <br>

            her body, and scattered at her feet. But thinking neither of <br>
            fillet, nor of floating veil, lost and undone, she was intent on <br>
            thee, Theseus, with her whole heart, and soul, and mind. <br>
            Ah wretched Ariadne, whom Venus doomed to distracting <br>
            sorrows,1 implanting thorny cares in thy bosom, what time <br>
            cruel Theseus, issuing from the curved shores of the Piræus,2 <br>
            reached the Gortynian3 abode of the unjust king.</p>
          <p>For ancient legends tell that, compelled by a dire pestilence <br>
            to atone for the murder of Androgeos, the Cecropian city4 <br>
            was wont to present choice youths and fairest virgins as food <br>
            for the Minotaur. Seeing that the little city was thus afflicted, <br>
            Theseus desired to sacrifice his own body for his dear Athens, <br>
            rather than that such unfuneralled funerals5 of Athens should <br>
            be carried to Crete. Borne therefore in a fleet ship by <br>
            gentle winds, he came to the arrogant6 Minos and his superb <br>
            abode. There as soon as the royal virgin beheld him with <br>
            desiring eye, she whom the chaste bed, breathing sweet <br>
            odours, cherished in her mother's soft embrace, lovely as the­ <br>
            myrtles which the waters of Eurotas7 rear, or the various- <br>
            coloured flowers which the breath of spring brings forth; <br>
            she did not take her glistening eyes off him until her whole <br>
            bosom was thoroughly on fire, and she burned to her inmost <br>
            marrow. Alas ! divine boy, who confoundest together human <br>
            joys and sorrows, with ruthless heart exciting wretched mor­ <br>

            been conceived by most commentators. Pasiphaë, Ariadne's mother, was <br>
            the daughter of the Sun and Perseis, one of the Oceanides; and Venus <br>
            persecuted all the descendants of Apollo, because that god discovered her <br>

            often sighing for the yellow-haired stranger ! What fears she <br>
            endured in her fainting heart! How often did she grow wan­ <br>
            ner than the sheen of gold ! When Theseus, eager to contend <br>
            with the dread monster, was about to encounter death or the <br>
            glory of victory, then did she timidly frame vows with silent, <br>
            lip 1 promising gifts to the gods, gifts not unacceptable to them, <br>
            but offered unprofitably for herself. For as an irresistible <br>
            whirlwind tears up an oak that shakes its branches on the <br>
            summit of Taurus, or a cone-bearing pine with oozing stem, <br>
            twisting the trunk with its. blast; uprooted it falls prone, <br>
            covering a wide space, and breaking all beneath it far and <br>
            near; so Theseus prostrated the carcase of the vanquished <br>
            monster, vainly tossing its horns to the empty air. Thence <br>
            he returned safely with great renown, directing his wander­ <br>
            ing steps by a slender thread, that the indistinguishable maze <br>
            might not baffle his attempt to issue from its labyrinthine <br>
            windings.</p>
          <p>But why, digressing from my first subject, need I tell more ? <br>
            How the daughter, forsaking her father's face, forsaking the <br>
            embrace of her sister, and even of her mother, who wept in <br>
            despair for her child, gladly preferred the sweet love of Theseus <br>
            to them all ? Or how their ship was borne to the foamy shores <br>
            of Dia ? Or how her husband, departing with ungrateful <br>
            breast, left her with her eyes closed in calamitous sleep ? Often, <br>
            'tis said, with a heart on fire with rage, she sent out shrill <br>
            shrieks in gushes2 from the bottom of her breast ; then sadly <br>
            climbed the precipitous mountains, whence she could stretch <br>
            forth her gaze over the wide billows ; then ran into the oppos­ <br>

            to the ignorant winds, which being endowed with no senses, <br>
            can neither hear uttered words, nor return any ? He is now <br>
            nearly mid-way on the sea, and no mortal appears on the <br>
            vacant beach. Thus cruel fortune, too much insulting me <br>
            in my last moments, grudges even ears to hear my lamenta­ <br>
            tions. Almighty Jove, would that neither in the beginning <br>
            the Cecropian ships had touched the Gnossian shores ; nor that <br>
            the perfidious mariner had ever unmoored for Crete, bringing <br>
            dire tribute to the unconquered bull ; nor that yon bad man, <br>
            concealing cruel purposes under a winning form, had rested <br>
            as a guest in our abode ! For whither shall I betake myself? <br>
            On what hope shall I, undone, rely ? Shall I seek the Cretan <br>
            mountains ? But the fierce severing sea divides me from them <br>
            with its wide expanse. Can I hope for aid from my father, <br>
            whom I left of my own accord to follow the youth stained <br>
            with my brother's gore ? Can I console myself with the <br>
            trusty love of a husband who flees from me, bending his <br>
            pliant oars in the deep ? If I pass from the shore, the <br>
            lonely island is without a roof; nor is there any exit open <br>
            from it, encompassed as it is by the waves. There is no <br>
            means of escape, no hope ; all around is silence and desolation ; <br>
            all around is death. Not however shall my eyes languish in <br>
            death, nor shall my senses depart from my weary body, before <br>
            I implore from the gods a just penalty for my betrayal, and <br>

            the firmament shook its glittering stars. But Theseus him­ <br>

            bosom all those injunctions which he before held fast in mind, <br>
            and hoisted no glad signals for his sad father, to show that he <br>
            was in sight of harbour safe and rescued. For they say that <br>

            was leaving the city of the goddess Pallas with his fleet, em­ <br>
            bracing his son, he gave the young man these injunctions:</p>
          <p>" My only son, dearer to me than long life, my son, lately <br>
            restored to me at the end of an extreme old age,1 and whom <br>
            I am compelled to send away to dangerous adventures, since <br>
            my ill fortune and thy hot valour tear thee away from me so <br>
            loth to part with thee, for not yet have my dim eyes had <br>
            enough of my son's dear face: not in joy and gladness of heart <br>
            will I send thee away, nor will I let thee show tokens of pros­ <br>
            perous fortune ; but first I will send forth many a lamentation <br>
            from my heart, defiling my white hairs with earth and dust ; <br>
            and then I will hang dyed sails upon the flitting mast, that so <br>
            the Iberian canvass with its dark dye may declare my grief, and <br>
            the burning anguish of my mind.; But if the dweller on sacred <br>
            Itone (who has promised us, her trusting votaries, to defend <br>
            our race and these abodes) grants thee to stain thy right hand <br>
            with the blood of the bull, then be sure that these injunctions <br>
            have force, stored up in thy heart, and that no lapse of time <br>
            obliterate them. As soon as thine eyes behold our hills, let <br>

          <p>As clouds driven by the breath of the winds leave a snowy <br>
            mountain's airy crest, so these injunctions departed from the <br>
            memory of Theseus, who had previously retained them with <br>
            constant mind. But his father, as he looked out from the top <br>
            of the fortress, wasting his anxious eyes in ceaseless tears, <br>
            when first he beheld the canvass of the inflated sail, threw <br>
            himself headlong from the top of the rocks, believing that <br>
            Theseus was lost by a cruel fate. Thus exulting Theseus, <br>
            entering a house woe-stricken by his father's death,' himself <br>
            encountered such sorrow as he had inflicted by his forgetful­ <br>
            ness on the daughter of Minos; while she, wholly rapt, still <br>

            In wild joy they raved all around him, yelling Evoë, Evoë, <br>
            and rolling their heads about. Some of them brandished <br>
            thyrsi with ivy-covered points ; some snatched away the <br>

            who neither inhabited Olympus with Jupiter, nor were of rank enough <br>
            to join his train. Catullus has with peculiar propriety selected those who <br>
            had promoted or were interested in the nuptials, or were connected by <br>
            some tie with the bride or bridegroom. The centaur Chiron, the inhabit­ <br>
            ant of Mount Pelion in Thessaly, the kingdom of Peleus, and afterwards <br>
            tutor of Achilles, the predestined offspring of the marriage, first bears his <br>
            offerings. Next Peneus, the offspring of Oceanus and Tethys, is selected <br>
            from the water deities as the most celebrated river of Thessaly, and as a <br>
            kinsman of the bride. He bears an appropriate offering of the trees that <br>
            grow on his banks, and with Chiron decks the palace with flowers and <br>
            boughs ; with which it was usual to decorate every part of the bride­ <br>
            groom's abode, and particularly the door, as we learn from Ovid, Fast. 4, <br>
            Juvenal, Sat. 6, and Plutarch in Erotico. To these are added Prome­ <br>
            theus, who, by his prophecy of the powerful offspring to spring from <br>
            Thetis, had induced Jupiter to sanction her union with Peleus, and might <br>
            regard the wedding as his own work. These three are the fitting fore­ <br>
            runners of the celestial host, who, with Jupiter, descend from Olympus <br>
            to honour the bridal which he had sanctioned.—Lambe. </note> <br>

          <p>Thus prophesying in days of yore, the Fates sang the happy <br>
            destinies of Peleus with divine omen. For formerly, ere virtue <br>
            was yet despised, the inhabitants of heaven were wont to visit <br>
            in person the guiltless abodes of heroes, and to show them­ <br>
            selves in mortal assemblies. Often did the father of the gods, <br>
            revisiting 1 his splendid temple, when the annual solemnities <br>
            arrived with the festal days, behold a hundred chariots run­ <br>
            ning along the ground. Often did roving Bacchus drive his <br>
            screaming Thyads with dishevelled hair from the highest <br>
            peak of Parnassus,2 when the Delphians, eagerly rushing out <br>
            from the whole city, joyfully welcomed the god with smoking <br>
            altars. Often, in the deadly strife of war, Mars, or the mistress <br>
            of the rapid Triton,3 or the Rhamnusian virgin,4 in person <br>
            exhorted armed troops of men. But after the earth was <br>
            stained with nefarious crime, and all men drove out justice <br>
            from their covetous souls; after brothers drenched their hands <br>
            in brothers' blood ; the son ceased to mourn his dead parents; <br>
            the father desired the death of his firstborn son, that he might <br>

            opinion that " it approached nearer to the divinity of the Iliad than any <br>
            other poem." He might however have added, that some part of that <br>
            divinity was even borrowed from it. The parting of Egeus and Theseus <br>
            is the prototype of that of Evander and Pallas; the despair of Dido is <br>
            worked up with sentiment and passion probably suggested by that of Ari­ <br>
            adne ; and even the beautiful commemoration of Marcellus is an im­ <br>
            provement upon the prophecy of the career of Achilles.—Lambe. Ovid <br>
            has treated the subject of Ariadne not less than four times, and has bor­ <br>
            rowed largely from Catullus. In the Epistle of Ariadne to Theseus he <br>
            has painted, like his predecessor, her disordered person, her sense of de­ <br>
            sertion, and remembrance of the benefits she had conferred on Theseus. <br>
            But the epistle is a cold production, chiefly because her grief is not im­ <br>
            mediately presented before us; and she merely tells that she had wept, <br>
            and sighed, and raved. The minute detail, too, into which she enters, is <br>
            inconsistent with her vehement passion. She recollects too well each <br>
            heap of sand which retarded her steps, and the thorns on the summit of <br>
            the mountain. Returning from her wanderings, she addresses her couch, <br>
            of which she asks advice, till she becomes overpowered by apprehension <br>
            for the wild beasts and marine monsters, of which she presents her false <br>
            lover with a faithful catalogue. The simple ideas of Catullus are fre­ <br>
            quently converted into conceits, and his natural bursts of passion into <br>
            quibbles and artificial points. In the eighth book of the Metamorphoses, <br>
            the melancholy part of Ariadne's story is only recalled in order to intro­ <br>
            . duce the transformation of her crown into a star. In the third book of <br>
            the Fasti, she deplores the double desertion of Theseus and Bacchus. <br>
            It is in the first book of the Art of Love that Ovid approaches nearest to <br>
            Catullus, particularly in the sudden contrast between the solitude ar 1 <br>

            which she, outstretching her smooth arms, had promised to <br>
            many gods, at the time when the king, recently blest in mar­ <br>
            riage, and bearing marks of the nocturnal struggle in which <br>
            he had been engaged for the virgin's spoils, had gone to lay <br>
            waste the Assyrian territory. Is Venus odious to the newly <br>
            wedded ? Why do brides frustrate their parents' joys by the <br>
            feigned tears they pour out profusely within the nuptial <br>
            chamber ? Their grief is not real, so help me the gods! <note type="footnote"> cept the interpretation given by Muretus, " Do not think that your words <br>
            have lapsed from my mind like an apple from a girl's bosom," then indeed <br>
            the comparison is quite frigid. But this was not what Catullus intended ; <br>
            his meaning was, " It is true I forgot for a while what I had promised <br>
            you, but forgot it just as it sometimes happens to a maiden to forget a <br>
            thing she prizes most dearly, and to be overcome with shame and confu­ <br>
            sion when she is suddenly reminded of her inattention." </note><note type="footnote"> } Berenice's Hair.] According to Hyginus, whom all the commentators <br>
            have implicitly followed, Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus <br>
            and Arsinoe, married her brother Ptolemy Euergetes, in accordance with <br>
            the Egyptian custom. But we know from Justin, lib. xxvi. c. 3, that <br>
            Berenice was not really Ptolemy's sister, but his cousin-german, a rela­ <br>
            tionship to which ancient usage gave the name of sisterhood. Her hus­ <br>
            band having soon afterwards marched with his army into Syria, Berenice <br>
            devoted her beautiful locks to Venus on condition of her husband's vic­ <br>
            torious return. Her prayers were heard, and she suspended her locks <br>
            with her own hand in the temple of the goddess, whence they disappeared <br>
            before the next morning, to the great vexation of both the royal consorts. <br>
            Conon, a famous astronomer of Samos, and a no less adroit courtier, <br>
            averred that a divine hand had withdrawn them, and placed them among <br>
            the stars. On this hint Callimachus composed a poem, which Catullus <br>
            has here imitated. But though the poem of Callimachus may have been <br>
            seriously written, and gravely read by the court of Ptolemy, the lines of <br>
            Catullus often approach to something like pleasantry or persiflage. The <br>
            original is lost, which is the more unfortunate, as no work of Catullua <br>
            has been more disfigured by transcribers than this. </note> <br>

            This truth my queen taught me by her many lamentations, <br>
            when her newly-wedded spouse set out for grim battles. It <br>
            was not, however, for the loneliness of thy deserted bed that <br>
            thou didst grieve, but for the sad departure of thy dear bro­ <br>
            ther, when sorrow so consumed thy very marrow, and thy <br>
            whole bosom was so racked, that sense and reason departed! <br>
            But surely I have known thee magnanimous since thou wast <br>
            but a little maiden. Hast thou forgotten that good deed,' by <br>
            which thou didst win a royal marriage, a deed than which <br>
            none ever dared to do a bolder?2 But what words thou didst <br>
            utter at thy sad parting from thy husband ! 0 Jupiter ! how <br>
            often thou didst wipe thine eyes with thy hand! What <note type="footnote"> 1 That good deed.] Hyginus gives a romantic and incredible explana­ <br>
            tion of these verses, in which he is followed by modern commentators. <br>
            Berenice is represented as a heroine, who broke horses, drove chariots, <br>
            and practised all military exercises. The exploit here alluded to was, <br>
            they say, her rescue of her father in battle, when surrounded by enemies ; <br>
            in reward for which her brother married her. But the poet certainly <br>
            alludes to a memorable passage in history, related by Plutarch in his Life <br>
            of Demetrius. Magas, the uterine brother of Ptolemy Philadelphus, was <br>
            by the influence of his mother promoted to the government of Cyrene and <br>
            Libya. (Pausanias in Attic.) He governed those provinces many years <br>
            with ability, and having fortified his own power by the affection of the <br>
            natives and by his marriage with Apame, daughter of Antiochus Soter, <br>
            king of Syria, he determined to secure to his own family the dominion of <br>
            the countries which he had long ruled as a viceroy. His revolt was suc­ <br>
            cessful ; but the supposed contingency which had at first inspired him <br>
            with disaffection to his brother, failed to happen. He had reached the <br>
            extremity of old age, and his queen Apame had brought him no male <br>
            children, and only one daughter, Berenice. Under this disappointment <br>
            Magas expressed a desire to compose all differences with his brother <br>
            Ptolemy Philadelphus, by marrying his only daughter with Ptolemy's <br>
            eldest son, and giving as her dower the restored allegiance of Cyrene and <br>
            Libya. The treaty was accepted, but Magas died before the conditions <br>
            of it were executed. The ambitious Apame, unwilling that her husband's <br>
            independent kingdom should sink into a tributary province, invited to <br>
            Cyrene Demetrius, the brother of Antigonus Gonatas, king of Macedon, <br>
            promising him her daughter in marriage. But the figure and accomplish­ <br>
            ments of this young prince changed her resolutions and captivated her <br>
            affections. Demetrius, instead of marrying the daughter, became the <br>
            paramour of the mother. But the slighted Berenice determined to avenge <br>
            her wrongs. A conspiracy was formed in the palace. Demetrius was <br>
            slain in the embraces of Apame; the daughter conducting the assassins <br>
            to the chamber and bed of her mother. Apame was sent into Syria, and <br>
            Berenice repaired to Alexandria, and consummated her marriage with <br>
            young Ptolemy, afterwards called Euergetes.—Tytler. </note><note type="footnote"> 2A deed than which, &amp;c.] Quo nonfortius ausit alis. Alis for alius. </note> <br>

            mighty god thus changed thee ? Was this because lovers are <br>

            Thia2 was borne, when the Medes swept through a new sea, <br>
            and the Barbarian youth navigated through the midst of <br>
            Athos. What can hairs do when such things yield to steel ? <br>

            ever in the beginning instituted the practice of seeking out <br>
            veins under ground and forging hard iron ! My sister hairs, <br>
            just before separated from me, were bewailing my fate, when <br>
            Æthiopian Memnon’s brother, the winged steed of Chloris, <br>
            beating the air with quivering wings, presented himself in <br>
            Arsinoe's temple, and catching me up flew through the dusky <br>
            ether and laid me in the chaste bosom of Venus.4 Zephyritis <note type="footnote"> 1 Unwillingly, &amp;c.] Macrobius remarks that Virgil, who was well <br>

            Canopian shores, to the end that not only the golden crown <br>

            of heaven, but that we, the consecrated spoils of Berenice's <br>
            yellow head, might shine there too. As moist with tears I <br>
            entered the temple of the gods, divine Venus placed me as a <br>
            new constellation among the ancient ones. For contiguous <br>

            by night, 1 yet by day I am restored to the bosom of white- <br>
            haired Tethys. Let me be allowed to say these things witb­ <br>

            truth from any fear; no, though the stars assail me with in­ <br>
            vectives, I will unfold the secret feelings of my sincere mind : <br>
            I am not so rejoiced by these events, as not to be tortured by <br>
            the thought that I am for ever parted from the head of my <br>
            mistress, with whom I imbibed many thousand fragrant oint­ <br>
            ments, though whilst she was yet a virgin I never had any.2</p>

            your onyx box presents me with pleasing libations ; let your <br>
            onyx box do this, all you who seek the rights of wedlock in <br>

            mythological intricacies to make this whole passage one of the most ob­ <br>
            scure in the works of Catullus. Briefly, its meaning appears to be this : <br>
            Zephyrus, son of Aurora, brother of Memnon, and husband of Chloris, <br>
            carried off the hair by order of Venus, who is also called Arsinoe, from <br>
            her temple in the town of that name founded by Ptolemy Philadelphia i <br>
            in honour of his sister-spouse; and Zephyritis, from the Egyptian pro­ <br>
            montory of Zephyrium where she was worshipped. Some commentators <br>
            make Zephyritis identical with Chloris. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The footsteps of the gods press me.] The Coma Berenices is situated <br>

            send me this epistle blotted with your tears, praying me to <br>
            raise you up as a shipwrecked man flung ashore by the foam­ <br>
            ing billows, and to rescue you from the gates of death; and <br>
            telling me that neither sacred Venus suffers you to enjoy soft <br>
            slumber in your lonely, deserted bed, nor do the Muses delight <br>
            you with the sweet strains of old poets, whilst your sorrow­ <br>
            ing mind knows no rest; this is gratifying to me, for as much <br>
            as you esteem me your friend, and therefore ask of me the <br>
            gifts of the Muses and of Venus. But that my sorrows may <br>
            not be unknown to you, Manlius, and that you may not sup­ <br>
            pose I shrink from the duties incumbent on your guest,2 hear <br>
            now in what billows of misfortune I myself am plunged, and <br>
            ask no more for the gifts of the happy from a wretch like <br>
            me.</p>
          <p>When first the white robe3 was conferred upon me, when <br>
            my flowery years were in their jocund spring, I disported <br>
            variously enough;4 I have not been unknown to the goddess <note type="footnote"> I To Manlius.] Most commentators conclude from the fifth and sixth lines <br>
            of this poem that it was addressed to Manlius on the occasion of the death <br>
            of his wife Julia, celebrated in the first epiihalamium. But this seems <br>
            incongruous with the wish expressed at the end of the piece, that Man­ <br>
            lius and the lady, whoever she was, who is emphatically termed " his <br>
            life," may long live happily together. Doering supposes that the fond <br>
            pair had quarrelled ; but that hypothesis fails also if tried by the same <br>
            test; besides, the poet offers no hint or inducement towards reconciliation, <br>
            as he would naturally have done in such a case. It is to be regretted that <br>
            we are left in the dark as to the occasion on which this poem was com­ <br>
            posed, for we are thus deprived of the means of clearing up many of its <br>
            obscurities, and of becoming reconciled to many things in it which now <br>
            appear as blemishes upon a work which presents many extraordinary <br>
            beauties. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Your guest.] The Romans regarded hospitality as a permanent <br>
            mutual relation, and assigned to it a high place among the duties of life. <br>
            Aulus Gellius thus classifies social duties in the order in which they are <br>
            to be preferred when they happen to clash with each other-First, the <br>
            duty towards parents and guardians; next, that towards clients and <br>
            adopted dependants; thirdly, the duties of those who accepted or inter- <br>
            changed hospitality; and lastly, duties towards kindred and relations. <br>
            The duties of hospitality, he says, arc sometimes placed second. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The white robe.] The toga virilis, assumed at the age of puberty, and <br>

            who mingles sweet bitterness1 with our cares. But my brother's <br>
            death has absorbed all such tastes in grief. 0 my brother, <br>
            whose loss hath left me wretched ! Thou hast broken all my <br>
            enjoyments by thy death, brother; our whole house is buried <br>
            along with thee ; with thee have perished all my delights, <br>
            which thy dear love fostered in thy lifetime. Since thy de­ <br>
            parture I have wholly abandoned all my fondness for poetry, <br>
            and all my favourite pursuits. Therefore as for what you <br>
            write, that " It is a shame for Catullus to be at Verona, for <br>
            there a man of mark must warm his cold limbs in his solitary <br>
            bed ;"2 this is not shameful, Manlius ; say rather it is pitiable. <br>
            You will pardon me then if I do not send you those gifts of <br>
            which sorrow has bereft me, since I am unable. For that I <br>
            have no great stock of writings by me is a result of my living <br>
            at Rome; that is my home, my domicile; there my life is <br>
            passed. Only one case of books3 out of many has accom­ <br>
            panied me to this place. This being so, I would not have <br>
            you conclude that it is from ill will, or illiberality of mind on <br>
            my part, that both your requests are not fulfilled. I would <note type="footnote"> with the Muses ; others, I dallied with love; we rather think that <br>
            Catullus meant both. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Sweet bitterness.] This was a familiar idea with the ancients, and <br>
            Byron's imitation of Lucretius has naturalized it in England: <br>
            Medio de fonte leporum <br>
            Surgit amari aliqnid quod in ipsis floribus angat. <br>
            Full from the fount of joy's delicious springs <br>
            Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings. <br>
            Anacreon, Ode 45, describes the manufacture of Cupid's arrow-heads: <br>
            Vulcan forges them, Venus then dips them in honey, and Cupid after­ <br>
            wards in gall. Claudian gives a somewhat different account of the mat­ <br>
            tar : <br>
            Labuntur gemini fontes, hie dulcis, amarus <br>
            Alter, et infusis corrumpit melle venenis, <br>
            Unde Cupidineas armavit fama sagittas. <br>
            In Cypris' isle two rippling fountains fall, <br>
            And one with honey rlows and one with gall; <br>
            In these, if we may take the tale from fame, <br>
            The son of Venus dips his darts of flame. MOORE. </note><note type="footnote"> 3It is a shame, &amp;c.] Lamb, and many others before him, have <br>
            strangely mistaken the meaning of this passage, as though it signified <br>
            that while Catullus buried himself in a provincial town, others were taking <br>
            the place he left vacant by Lesbia's side at home. </note><note type="footnote"> Case of books.] Capsula, a portable case in which the ancients kept <br>

          <p>I cannot forbear, 0 goddesses, to tell in what things <br>
            Manlius has aided me, and how great has been his kindness, <br>
            lest fleeting, oblivious time veil in obscurity this friendship of <br>
            his for me. But I will tell you all: do you tell it again to <br>

          <p>For you know, Muses, what anxiety wily Venus2 caused <br>
            me. and in what manner she fired my bosom; when it boiled <br>
            like the bowels of Ætna, or the Malian fountain in Œtæan <br>
            Thermopylæ;3 when my eyes were bedimmed with incessant <br>
            tears, and my cheeks were wet with sad showers. As the <br>
            limpid stream bursts from the mossy stone on the airy moun­ <br>
            tain's crest, and having rolled down the sloping valley, makes <br>
            its way through the midst of a dense population, presenting a <br>
            sweet refreshment to the weary traveller, when the oppressive <br>
            heat makes the parched fields crack and gape: and as a soft <br>
            and favouring wind comes to mariners whom a black tempest <br>
            has tossed, and who invoke the aid of Castor and Pollux ; such, <br>
            and so helpful has Manlius been to me. He widely extended <br>
            the its of my narrow domain ; he gave me the house I dwell <br>

            duplex has the same meaning as that in which Horace applies it to <br>
            Ulysses. Scaliger understands by it Venus Urania and the common <br>
            Venus. Vossius and Vulpius think it alludes to the Venus with two <br>

            my fair divinity turned her light steps,' and halted on the <br>
            threshold, pressing it with her shining foot and creaking san­ <br>
            dals.2 So came of yore Laodamia,3 burning with love, to the <br>
            home of Protesilaus, a home she entered with hopes doomed to <br>
            be frustrated, since no victim had yet propitiated the lords of <br>
            heaven with consecrated blood. May nothing, 0 Nemesis, <br>
            ever engage my affections so strongly, as that I should rashly <br>
            enter upon its enjoyment without the sanction of the gods. <br>
            Laodamia learned by the loss of her husband how hungrily <br>
            the altar craves for sacrificial blood ; for she was compelled to <br>
            quit the neck of her lately wedded spouse, before a second <br>
            return of the long winter nights had so satisfied her eager love, <br>
            that she could survive the dissolution of her marriage, which <br>
            the Fates knew would not be far remote in time, if her hus­ <br>
            band went in arms to the walls of Ilium. For Troy had then <br>
            begun to provoke the leaders of the Greeks against it by the <br>
            rape of Helen : accursed Troy ! the common sepulchre of <br>
            Europe and Asia; Troy, the cruel grave of brave men and <br>
            noble qualities ; to which I also owe the lamentable death of <br>
            my brother. 0 brother, lost to my sorrow ! 0 light of glad­ <br>

            thy sweet love fostered in hy lifetime. Now, an alien land <br>
            holds thee so far from me, in its remote soil, laid not among <br>
            familiar tombs, not near kindred ashes, but buried in infamous, <br>
            unhappy Troy.</p>
          <p>Thither hastened from all quarters the whole manhood of <br>

            before Troy. She desired to see his shade, and died embracing :t. </note> <br>

            wast bereft of a spouse dearer to thee than life and soul. A <br>
            very whirlpool of love had sucked thee in, and plunged thee <br>
            down a gulf as deep as the rich soil which the Greeks tell us <br>
            was dried by the drainage of the marsh near Cyllenean Phe­ <br>
            neus, and which the falsely supposed son of Amphitryon is <br>
            said to have dug, when he cut through the hearts of moun­ <br>
            tains, at the time when he smote the Stymphalian monsters <br>
            with his sure arrows, by command of a less valiant lord ;1 that <br>
            the gateway of heaven might be trodden by a divinity the <br>
            more, and that Hebe2 might not be long a virgin. But thy <br>
            deep love was deeper than that gulf which taught the god to <br>
            bear tamely the yoke of a master.3 For no only daughter <br>
            rears a late-born child so dear to his aged grandsire, a child <br>
            who, when hope was almost gone, appears at last as heir to <br>
            his ancestral wealth, has had his name inserted in the attested <br>
            will, and thus extinguishing the unkindly joy of the baffled <br>
            next of kin, drives away the vulture that hovered over the <br>
            grandsire's hoary head ; 4 nor did any dove ever delight so <br>
            much in its snowy mate, (though that bird is said to surpass <br>
            all others in the indefatigable ardour of its billing kisses,) as <br>
            thou didst, Laodamia. though woman is pre-eminently incon­ <br>
            stant. But thou alone didst surpass every great love ever <br>
            known, when once thou wast united with thy yellow-haired <br>

            bear with the few infidelities of my discreet mistress, that I <br>
            may not make myself intolerable as fools do. [Often, even Juno, <br>
            the greatest of the celestial goddesses, raged at the daily faults <br>
            of her consort, knowing the many amours of most volatile <br>
            Jove. But it is not meet that men should be compared with <br>
            gods.] Let me be rid however of the annoying burthen of her <br>
            fidgetty father. Why should he interfere ? For she was not <br>
            delivered to me by a father's hand, when she came to my <br>
            house scented with Assyrian perfume ; but quitting the very <br>
            bosom of her husband, she bestowed furtive favours on me in <br>
            that delicious night. Enough then, if she gives to me alone <br>
            that day which she marks with a white stone.</p>
          <p>I send you, Manlius, this gift of verse, the best I could <br>

            or that, or another, may not touch your name with the un­ <br>

            What could Diana's motto be ? <br>
            The syren wrote upon the shore: <br>

            And then her two large languid eyes <br>
            So turn'd on mine, that, devil take me, <br>

            he is not a man, but a great thundering mentula. Mahérault has hap­ <br>

            poem is the Festival of Venus, which was celebrated on the first three <br>
            of April, beginning at nightfall on the last day of March. For, <br>
            Bays Macrobius, Saturnal. i. 21, " When the sun ascends above the <br>
            .ower parts of the earth, and passes the bounds of the vernal equinox, <br>
            lengthening the days, then is Venus glad, the fair fields are green with <br>
            corn, the meadows with grass, the trees with leaves. For this reason our <br>
            forefathers dedicated the month of April to Venus." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Produced Dione.] The " celestial blood” of which Dione or Venus <br>

          <p>She paints the year with flowers that purple it as with <br>
            gems ; she urges the buds, swelling with the breath of Zephyr, <br>
            into the warm bridal bed of air ;'2 she scatters the bright dewy <br>
            moisture left by the humid air of night; how its tears glitter <br>
            and tremble as if they would fall; but each pendent drop re­ <br>
            mains self-balanced by its little orb. That moisture which <br>
            the stars shed in the calm night loosens the virgin buds in the <br>
            morning from their humid robe, and displays the crimson <br>
            blushes of the flower. She has commanded that to-morrow <br>
            all the virgins shall wear roses. The rose tinged with the blood <br>
            of Venus,3 perfumed by the kisses of Love, and glowing with <br>
            the lustre of gems, of flames, of the sun's orient splendours, <br>
            to-morrow will not be ashamed to loose as a bride her last <br>
            knot, and display the crimson concealed beneath her robe of <br>
            fire.</p>

          <p>The goddess hath bidden the Nymphs assemble in the myrtle <br>

            trusted as a harmless associate in the festival if he carries his <br>
            arrows. Go, Nymphs; Love has laid aside his arms, he is <br>
            harmless. He is ordered to go unarmed and naked, that he <br>
            may do no mischief with his bow, or his arrows, or his torch. <br>
            Yet, Nymphs, beware, for Cupid is beautiful. Love is all <br>

          <p>Virgin of Delos, Venus sends thee virgins modest as thy­ <br>

            to her awhile unsullied by the slaughters of the chase. She <br>
            would fain invite thee if thy maiden modesty would yield to <br>
            her prayer. She would gladly see thee at her festival if the <br>
            scene were not repugnant to thy virgin mind. For three <br>
            nights thou wouldst see the festive choirs, crowned with <br>
            dowers, wandering through the groves, or disporting in its <br>
            myrtle bowers. Ceres and Bacchus1 will be there, and the <br>
            god of the poets ; the whole wakeful night will resound with <br>
            song. Dione shall reign in the woods; give place to her, <br>

            After the line of the original beginning Nec Ceres, nec Bacchus, Lipsius <br>
            places the four following, which he believes to be by the author of the <br>

            Hie Apollo, deinde Liber hîc videtur ignifer ; <br>

            “ Here are seen Apollo and fire-giving Bacchus ; both were born of flames <br>
            and begotten of fire; both shed warmth from what crowns their brows, <br>

            to nurture all its germs of life. The great procreant goddess <br>
            herself breathing through all the veins and the mind, governs <br>

            of the air with the earth, and it is renewed every year in spring. This <br>
            idea, and the very forms in which it is here expressed, are taken from <br>
            Virgil, Georg. ii. 325. Stanley cites a kindred passage from Euripides, <br>
            which he thus renders : <br>
            How far Cythera's power extends <br>

            flock to the shade with the rams ; the lakes resound with the <br>
            hoarse voice of the swan; and the goddess has forbidden the <br>
            tuneful birds to be silent. The nightingale sings in the shade <br>
            of the poplar, that you would suppose she was uttering in <br>
            music the emotions of love, not that she was complaining to <br>
            her sister of the barbarity of Tereus. She sings: we are silent! <br>
            When shall my spring come? When shall I be like Chelidon, <br>
            and silent never more? I have lost the Muse's favour by <br>
            keeping silence, and Phœbus no longer regards me. So was <br>

            Cuieta and Terracina. Its people having been frequently terrified by false <br>
            alarms of the approach of besiegers, passed a law forbidding that any <br>
            one should make report of danger on any grounds whatever. The be. <br>
            siegers came at last, and the place was taken by surprise. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was with reference to this poem that Dousa (Van des Deos) plan­ <br>
            ned a hoax upon his learned contemporaries, like that which Muretus <br>
            practised on Scaliger. He gave out that one of his friends had seen <br>
            another Vigil in a library in France, and had retained these four lines of <br>
            it in his memory- <br>
            Nemo tentis mentulis det, nemo nervis otium. <br>
            Ecce passeres salaces, ecce rauci turtures, <br>
            Hac super virenti myrto nos amoris admonent. <br>
            Nemo tentis, etc. <br>
            The trick succeeded ; the learned unanimously recognised the genuine <br>
            air of antiquity in this fragment; and when they were undeceived, they <br>
            consoled them as Scaliger had done, by virulently abusing the clever <br>

            with a view to repairing the poet's fortunes, appears to have been the <br>
            occasion of this Elegy, in which Tibullus declares his determination to <br>
            abandon the pursuit of wealth and power, and to retire to the country, <br>
            there to lead a life of calm and simple enjoyment with the girl of his <br>
            heart. We may confidently fix the date of the poem about the begin­ <br>
            ning of B. c. 31, the year in which Messala won the battle of Actium <br>
            for Octavius. According to Scaliger and Bronkhusius, whose arrange­ <br>
            ment of the text we generally follow, this Elegy consists of 92 lines: <br>
            Heyne and the Vulgate give it 78. Tibullus has suffered a twofold injury <br>
            at the hands of ignorant copyists, who, not content with mutilating and <br>
            changing his words, have in many instances broken the order of his <br>
            lines, and shuffled them about in pairs and in scores in the most ran­ <br>
            dom manner. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gold, &amp;c.] The poet here specifies wealth in money and wealth in <br>
            land, both however with reference to the " præmia militiæ.” The soldier <br>
            acquired gold by direct plunder from his foes, and at this period it was the <br>
            practice to make an assignment of land to each veteran when discharged <br>
            from service. </note><note type="footnote"> a Many acres.] Jugera. The Roman jugerum contained two actus. <br>

            data it is easily calculated that the jugerum was not quite two-thirds of <br>

            was a title of honour, equivalent, apparently, to chief or prince. Thus we <br>
            read of Lar Porsenna, king of Clusinm, Lar Tolumnius, king of the <br>
            Veiientes. The testimony of those among the Romans who were best quali­ <br>
            fied to form an opinion upon such a subject is so precise that we can enter­ <br>
            tain no doubt that, according to the poopular belief, the deities denominated <br>
            Lares were certain spirits of dead men, who were supposed to watch over <br>
            and protect the, living. They were very numerous, and were ranked in <br>
            classes according to the departments over which they presided, the'first <br>
            grand division beinginto private and public Lares. The former were <br>
            tutelary spirits who received the homage of all the individuals residing <br>
            under the same roof.The spot peculiarly sacred to them was the focus </note> <br>

            tim to come from my small estate. A lamb shall fall before <br>
            you, and round it the rustic youth shall cry : “ Io ! give us a <br>
            plenteous harvest and a good vintage.” Favour us with your <br>
            presence, gods ; scorn not the gifts of a poor table, nor liba­ <br>
            tions from clean pottery. Such vessels the husbandman of <br>
            yore made for himself and formed them of ductile clay. <br>
            And you, ye thieves and wolves, spare my few heads of <br>
            cattle, and take your prey from large herds. I do not regret <br>
            the wealth of my fathers, and the plenty which their stored <br>
            harvests afforded of yore. For me a small crop is enough; it <br>
            is enough to rest under my own roof, if I may, and to stretch <br>
            my limbs on my wonted couch. How delightful it is to hear <br>
            the pitiless winds as we lie in bed; and fold the mistress we <br>
            love to our bosom; or when the wintry south wind pours <br>
            down its sleety waters, to sleep on securely, lulled by the <br>
            plashing rain ! Let this be my lot. Let him grow rich, as is <br>

            sumptuous palaces of later times was not unfrequently enlarged into a <br>
            chapel with magnificent decorations. The public Laic' were of several <br>
            kinds: e. g. Lares Rurales, guardians of flocks, herds, and fruits of the <br>
            earth: the poet addresses these in the lines before us : Lares Compitales, <br>
            worshipped at the spot where two or more roads crossed ; Lares Præstites, <br>
            protectors of the city, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Lares bear a striking resemblance to <br>
            the saints of modern Italy. Moreover the holy books of the Etruscans <br>
            described certain sacred rites, by means of which the souls of men might <br>
            be changed into gods, a process somewhat analogous to canonization. <br>
            The Penates were the deities worshipped in the penus, or innermost part <br>
            of the house. Penates is a generic term,and includes the Lares and cer­ <br>
            tain other gods-who were worshipped at the hearth, especially Vesta, who <br>
            was herself the Goddess of the Hearth.—Ramsay. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Now I, who am content, &amp;c.] <br>

            Rom. Lit.) we find a passage which commends itself especially to the reader <br>
            of Tibullus : “ The Romans, and particularly the Roman poets, as if the <br>
            rustic spirit of their Italian ancestry was not altogether banished by the <br>
            buildings of Rome, appear to have had a genuine and exquisite relish for <br>
            the delights of the country ; not as we are apt to enjoy it, for the sake of <br>
            exercise or field sports, but for its amenity and repose, and the mental <br>
            tranquillity which it diffused. With them it seems to have been truly­ <br>
            ' The relish for the calm delight <br>
            Of verdant fields and fountains bright; <br>
            Trees that nod on sloping hills, <br>
            And caves that echo tinkling rills.' <br>
            Love of the country among the Romans thus became conjoined with the <br>
            idea of a life of pastoral tranquillity and retirement, a life of friendship, <br>
            liberty, and repose, free from labour and from care, and from all turbu­ <br>
            lent passions. Scenes of this kind delight and interest us supremely, <br>
            whether they be painted as what is hoped or what is enjoyed. We feel <br>
            how natural it is for a mind with a certain disposition to relaxation and <br>
            indolence, when fatigued with the bustle of life, to long for serenity and <br>
            quiet, and for those sequestered scenes in which they can be most exqui­ <br>
            sitely enjoyed. There is much less of this in the writings of the Greeks. <br>
            who were originally a scafaring and piratical, not, like the Italians, a pas­ <br>
            toral, people. It is thus that even in their highest stage of refinement <br>
            the manners and feelings of nations bear some affinity to their original <br>
            rudeness, though that rudeness itself has been imperceptibly converted <br>
            into a source of elegance and ornament." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gems.] Smaragdi. It appears extremely probable that the ancients <br>

            jasper, and green glass. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I sit, &amp;c.] A remark of Heyne's happily disposes of the apparent <br>

            spiritless! Let me be free to yoke my oxen so I be but with <br>
            thee, my Delia, and to feed my flock on the lone mountain ; <br>
            and, if I may but hold thee in my fond arms, soft be my sleep <br>
            on the rude ground ! What boots it to lie down on a Tyrian <br>
            couch without favouring love, when the sleepless night must <br>
            be passed in tears ? Vain then are down, and richly dyed <br>
            tapestry, and even the gentle murmuring of water, to induce <br>
            slumber. The man were iron who, when he could have thee, <br>
            should stupidly prefer to follow arms and rapine. He may <br>
            drive before him vanquished troops of Cilicians, and pitch <br>
            his martial camp on the conquered soil ; caparisoned all over <br>
            with gold and silver, he may bestride his swift steed in all the <br>
            pomp of his glory. Let me behold thee when my last hour is <br>
            come, thee let me hold with my dying hand.' Thou wilt weep, <br>
            Delia, when I am laid on the funeral pile, and thou wilt give <br>
            me kisses mingled with sad tears ; thy bosom is not cased in <br>
            hard iron, nor hast thou flint in thy'tender heart. No youth, <br>
            no virgin will be able to return from that funeral with dry <br>
            eyes. But pain not my Manes ; spare thy dishevelled hair, <br>
            Delia, and spare thy tender cheeks.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, as long as the fates permit, let us indulge our <br>
            mutual love. Soon death will come with its head wrapt in <br>
            gloom ; soon sluggish age will creep upon us ; nor will it be <br>
            seemly to love or to talk amorously with hoary heads. Now <br>
            is our time to ply light Venus, whilst we may without blush­ <br>
            ing break doors, and commit riotous frolics. In this warfare <br>
            I am a captain and a good soldier. Banners and trumpets, <br>
            begone ! Bestow wounds and rich booty on heroes who long <br>
            for them; as for me, secure in the store I possess, I will <br>
            despise both opulence and penury. <note type="footnote"> 1 Let me behold thee.] No other poet so often introduces the dismal <br>
            images of death. Tibullus does not, like Anacreon or Catullus, present <br>
            them for a moment, or on the back-ground of his pictures of joy, but ex­ <br>
            hibits them at full length and on the front of the canvass. When he <br>
            thinks of death he thinks so profoundly, and so long contemplates its <br>
            image, that the ideas it suggests must have occupied a large space in his <br>
            soul. Even to the most joyous thoughts of Tibullus some mournful or <br>
            plaintive sentiment is generally united, and his most gay and smiling <br>
            figures wear chaplets of cypress on their brows. While deeming himself <br>
            happy in comparison with the great Messala, because he will pass his life <br>
            unknown in the arms of Delia, he thus concludes his address to this be­ <br>
            loved mistress: “Let me behold thee," &amp;c. Dunlop. </note></p><pb n="110"/>

            Delia, be not afraid to elude thy guards. Be venturous ; <br>
            Venus herself aids the bold. She favours enterprise whether <br>
            some youth assays new thresholds or a girl opens the barred <br>

            speaking signs in presence of a husband, and to convey hidden <br>
            phrases of soft import in preconcerted tokens.</p>
          <p>Nor does she teach this to all, but only to those who are <br>
            neither laggards, nor forbidden by fear to rise in the dark night. <br>
            As for me, when I wander anxiously over the whole city in <br>

            fear any lurking dangers. I am not hurt by the numbing <br>
            cold of the winter nights ; nor when the rain falls in torrents ; <br>

            the sepulchres, and calls down the bones from the still <br>
            smouldering pile. Now she makes the infernal hosts swarm <br>
            round her with her magic screamings, and now she bids them <br>
            be gone, sprinkling them with milk. When she pleases, she <br>
            sweeps away the clouds from the sombre sky ; when she <br>
            pleases, she calls down the snow in summer by a word from <br>
            her mouth. She is said to possess alone all the evil herbs <br>

            will better explain this obscure piece of superstition. A lady who was <br>
            betrothed went with a young companion to the temple of the goddess of <br>
            marriage to watch the first words spoken by a woman. Anxiously at­ <br>
            tentive, she seated herself while her companion stood. Two hours having <br>
            passed without a word being uttered, or anybody entering the temple, <br>
            the younger at last said, " My deal, 1 am tired ; will you permit me to </note> <br>

            nosticated my return, yet nothing could hinder her from weep­ <br>
            ing and turning to look after me as I went. I myself, to <br>
            console her, when I had already given orders for my departure, <br>
            still anxiously sought for pretexts to delay; and alleged <br>
            either an unpromising appearance of the birds, or dire omens, <br>
            or that Saturn's unlucky day1 detained me. Oh how often <br>
            at the outset of my journey did I say that a stumble at the <br>
            threshold2 had given me sinister warning ! Let no one dare <br>
            to set out on a journey in spite of love, or if lie does, let him <br>

            corded with them. The betrothed lady died soon after, and the other was <br>
            married to the bridegroom in her stead. Another way-of- taking the lots <br>
            was by means of slips of parchment or pieces of wood, upon which certain <br>
            words or sentences were inscribed. They were shuffled together in a box <br>
            or urn ; one was drawn or shaken out at random, and a conclusion drawn <br>
            from the import of its inscription. Fortune-tellers drove a brisk trade in <br>
            Rome, and frequented the Forum, the Circus Maximus, and other places <br>
            of public resort. In the case before us, Delia sent a boy to a place where <br>
            three ways met, that he might watch for an omen; or if we read trinis <br>

            may be healed by thee, is proved by many a picture in thy <br>
            temples. Let my Delia, dressed in linen,1 sit before thy sacred <br>
            doors, performing vigils vowed for me ; and twice a day, with <br>
            hair unbound, conspicuous among the Pharian crowd, let her <br>
            recite thy due praises; but be it my lot to celebrate my native <br>
            Penates, and to offer monthly incense to my ancient Lar.</p>
          <p>How happily men lived when Saturn reigned, before the <br>
            earth was laid open by long roads ! Not yet had the pine <br>
            contemned the azure waves, and shaken out its bellying sails <br>
            to the winds, nor had the roving mariner, seeking gain in un­ <br>
            known lands, loaded his ship with foreign merchandise. In <br>
            those days the strong bull did not bear the yoke; the horse <br>
            did not champ the bit in his subject mouth; no house had <br>
            doors; there was no stone fixed on the fields, to mark the <br>
            precise boundaries of each man's crop ; the very oaks yielded <br>
            honey, and the sheep spontaneously offered their milky udders, <br>
            and gave no trouble to those who wanted them. There were <br>
            no armies, no enmity, no wars ; nor had the cruel smith forged <br>
            the sword with ruthless art.</p>
          <p>Now under the rule of Jove, slaughter and swords are in­ <br>
            cessant ; now sea and land offer a thousand ways of sudden <br>
            death. Spare me, Father ; I have not a conscience frightened <br>
            by any perjuries, or impious words uttered against the holy <br>
            gods. But if I have now completed my destined years, let a <br>
            stone stand over my bones, with this inscription :-Here lies <br>
            Tibullus, consumed by pitiless death, while following Messala <br>
            by land and sea.</p>
          <p>But because I am always obsequious to tender Love, Venus <br>
            herself will conduct me to the Elysian fields. There dance <br>
            and song are perpetual, and birds flitting in all directions <br>
            warble sweetly with their small throats. The uncultivated <br>
            vegetation bears cinnamon, and the benignant ground blooms <br>
            all over with fragrant roses. Groups of youth sport with <note type="footnote"> 1 Linen.] The priests of Egypt were,compelled to pay the most scru­ <br>
            pulous regard to personal cleanliness. To insure this, they shaved their <br>
            heads, and wore no garmets but such as were made of linen, and per­ <br>
            haps cotton. It appears from this passage that the worshippers of Isis, <br>
            when they appeared at his shrine, wore habits of this description, which <br>
            would be very remarkable at Rome, where the clothing of all ranks was <br>
            chiefly weollen. The fullest account of the worship of Isis is given by <br>
            Apuleius in the eleventh book of his Metamorphoses. </note> <br>

            tender damsels, and love incessantly mingles them in pleasing <br>
            strife. There is the place of every one whom rapacious death <br>
            interrupts in the midst of his love, and he bears myrtle wreaths <br>
            on his distinguished head.</p>
          <p>But the abode of guilt lies buried in deep night, and black <br>
            floods roar around it. There rages Tisiphone with fierce <br>
            tangled snakes for hair, and the crowd of the wicked flies <br>
            hither and thither before her. Black Cerberus hisses with <br>
            his serpents1 at the entrance, and watches before the brazen <br>
            gates. There the guilty limbs of Ixion, who dared to attempt <br>
            Juno, are whirled round on the rapid wheel, and Tityos, ex­ <br>
            tended over nine acres of ground, feeds the ever-ravening <br>
            birds with his dark entrails. Tantalus is there, with a lake <br>
            around him; but the water baffles his hot thirst just as he is <br>
            about to drink: and the children of Danaus, who committed <br>
            sacrilege against Venus, carry the water of Lethe into pierced <br>
            casks. There let him be, whosoever troubled my love, and <br>
            wished for me the tedious anxieties of warfare.</p>
          <p>But, Delia, remain faithful, I implore, and let an old woman <br>
            always sit by your side, a sedulous guardian of your sacred <br>
            modesty. Let her tell you stories, and fill long spindles with <br>
            the threads she draws from the distaffby lamp-light ; and let <br>
            the girl near her, intent on her busy task, yield gradually to <br>
            sleep and leave off her work. Then I will come suddenly; <br>
            no one shall announce me, but I shall seem to you as if I had <br>
            dropped from the sky. Then run to me, Delia, just as you <br>
            are, with bare feet and your long hair in disorder. This is my <br>
            prayer; may fair Aurora bring us that bright day with her <br>
            rosy horses.</p>

          <p>So said I, and thus answered the rustic son of Bacchus <br>
            armed with his curved sickle. " Be not disheartened, if haply <br>
            a girl refuse you at first; by degrees she will give her neck to <br>
            the yoke. Time has taught lions to obey man ; with time soft <br>
            water cuts its way through stone. A year ripens the grapes <br>
            on the sunny hills; a year brings round the changes of the <br>
            constellations in sure order. Be not afraid to swear; the <br>
            oaths broken in the sight of Venus the winds scatter over <br>
            land and sea. For this, great thanks to Jove : the great father <br>
            himself has forbidden to have any force, whatever oaths <br>
            thoughtless love may have eagerly sworn ; and Diana allows <br>
            you to pledge yourself with impunity by her arrows, and <br>
            Minerva by her hair. But if you are not prompt you will <br>
            miss all. Time passes away ! The day does not stand still, <br>
            or return. How soon the earth loses its brilliant hues! How <br>
            soon the tall poplar its comely tresses! How helpless lies, <br>
            when the fates of old age are come upon him, the courser that <br>
            was first to bound forth from the Elæan starting-place. I have <br>
            seen one who was but now a youth, lamenting, when graver <br>
            years pressed upon him, the days that had passed foolishly <br>
            away. Cruel gods ! the serpent casts his skin and comes forth <br>
            anew every year: but the Fates have granted no delay to <br>
            beauty. Eternal youth belongs to Phœbus and Bacchus alone, <br>
            for unshorn locks adorn both gods.</p>
          <p>" Whatever your fair one has a mind to do, let her have <br>
            her own way. Love achieves many victories by compliance. <br>
            Do not refuse to accompany her, though a long journey <br>
            is intended, and the fiery dog-star parches the fields; though <br>
            the watery bow, marking the sky with its parti-coloured <br>
            dyes, portend the coming rain. Or if she desires to roam <br>
            over the azure waves, ply the oar yourself and speed the light <br>
            bark over the waters. Grudge not to undergo hard labour, <br>
            and to chafe your hands unused to such work. And if she <br>
            wishes to enclose deep valleys with the hunter's toils, let not <note type="footnote"> to gender. This change has occasioned some awkwardness in a few <br>
            places; but without it the poem, which is one of the most elegant of the <br>

            your shoulders refuse to carry the nets, if so you may please <br>
            her. If she will practise arms, you will try to fence with a <br>
            light hand, and often expose your unguarded side that she may <br>
            make a hit. Then she will be indulgent; then you will be <br>
            allowed to snatch sweet kisses; she will struggle, but give <br>
            them after all. First she will give what you steal; afterwards <br>
            she will offer them for you to take, and at last she will freely <br>
            clasp your neck.</p>
          <p>" Alas, how vilely these times treat unfortunate art. The <br>
            tender girl is now grown used to desire presents. Now may <br>

            song were not, ivory would not have shone from the shoulder <br>

            has trees, the sky has stars, the river rolls waters. But whoso <br>
            hears not the Muses, whoso [buys or] sells love, be it theirs <br>
            to follow the chariot of Idan Ops, let them fill three hundred <br>
            cities with their wanderings, and mutilate their vile bodies in <br>
            Phrygian fashion. Venus desires that there be room for the <br>
            winning ways of courtship ; she favours plaintive supplica­ <br>
            tions and piteous tears."</p>
          <p>These precepts the god delivered to me that I might sing <br>
            them to Titia, but Titia's spouse bids her not mind them. <br>
            “ 0 beware of trusting the amorous crowd of youths," he says. <br>
            " for they never want a plausible pretext for love. This one <br>
            finds favour because he reins the steed with address; that <br>
            one, because he cleaves the calm waters with snowy breast; <br>
            another captivates, because he is strong and daring; and a <br>
            fourth, because maiden modesty sits upon his soft cheeks."</p>
          <p>Let her obey her monitor ; but as for you, whom the wily <br>
            boy maltreats, extol me as your guide and master. To each <br>

            work of a cunning bawd who interferes for my destruction. <br>
            May she eat bloody food, and drink with gory mouth cups all <br>
            bitter with gall. May souls complaining of their fate always <br>
            hover round her, and the screech-owl hoot wildly on her roof. <br>
            Goaded to madness by hunger, may she pluck grass from the <br>
            sepulchres, and the bones left by ravening wolves. May she <br>
            run naked and howling through the towns, and snarling packs <br>
            of dogs hunt her from the cross-ways. It will come to pass; <br>
            a god forebodes it; there is a divinity in a lover, and Venus <br>
            unjustly forsaken takes dire vengeance.</p>

          <p>LOVE, thou offerest me always a smiling countenance in <br>
            order to allure me; but afterwards I find thee, to my sorrow, <br>
            gloomy and severe. What quarrel hast thou with me, cruel <br>
            boy ? Is it a great glory for a god to have laid snares for a <br>
            man ? Toils are now spread for me ; now crafty Delia fur­ <br>
            tively cherishes I know not whom2 in the silent night. She <br>
            indeed denies this over and over again; but it is hard to be­ <br>
            lieve her, for she makes just as pertinacious denials about me <br>
            to her husband. Unfortunate that I am, I taught her myself <br>
            how to elude her guardians; alas, alas ! I am now the victim <br>
            of my own art. She has now learned how to invent pre­ <br>
            tences for lying alone, and how to make the doors turn on <br>
            noiseless hinges. And then I gave her juices and herbs, for <note type="footnote"> I Elegy VII.] This must have been written before the preceding Elegy, <br>
            (and probably in A. U. c. 724,) for here he only suspects what there he <br>
            speaks of as a fact already beyond all doubt. The unfortunate lover <br>
            complains that he is caught in his own trap, for he has taught Delia how <br>
            to deceive. Then he appeals to her husband, makes a clean breast of it, <br>
            and invites the poor man to make common cause with him. This is <br>
            rather a bold step, it must be owned ; it is asking too much, as Ovid says, <br>
            Trist. ii. 457 : <br>
            Denique ab incauto nimium petit ille marito <br>
            Se quoque uti servet, peccet ut ilia minus. <br>
            Grainger and Dunlop are shocked at the impropriety of this proceeding, <br>
            but without much reason. They forget the class to which Delia belonged, <br>
            and the probability that her intimacy with Tibullus was no news to her <br>
            husband. The address to that person is an exquisite piece of persiflage <br>
            and nothing more. </note><note type="footnote"> a / know not whom.] Nescio quern: this is not to be understood liter <br>

          <p>But you, incautious husband of the tricksome girl, keep <br>
            me too, that she may be hindered from erring at all. Take <br>
            care that she is not profuse in her compliments to young <br>
            men, nor let her recline with her robe loose so as to ex­ <br>
            pose her bosom ; let her not betray you with secret looks and <br>
            nods, nor dip her finger in liquid, and draw marks on the table. <br>
            If she goes out very often, be on your guard; or if she says <br>
            she intends to visit the rites of the Bona Dea to which males <br>
            are not admitted. But if you will intrust her to me, I will <br>
            follow her alone to the altar; and then far it be from me to <br>
            doubt the vigilance of my own eyes. I remember that I often <br>
            touched her hand under pretence of examining her jewels or <br>
            her seal. Often I plied you with strong wine till you fell <br>
            asleep, while I secured my victory by drinking sober draughts <br>
            mingled with water. I did not wrong you intentionally; for­ <br>
            give me, as I confess my fault; Love commanded it should be <br>
            so, and who can fight against the gods ? I am the very man, <br>
            nor will I now be ashamed to tell the truth, at whom your dog <br>
            used to bark all night long. It is not for nothing that some <br>
            one just now is always stopping before your threshold; that he <br>
            looks about, retreats, pretends to pass the house, and presently <br>
            comes back alone, and hawks and hems close by the door. Some <br>
            furtive amour is preparing for you, I know not what; bestir <br>
            yourself, I beg, while you may; as yet your boat swims in <br>
            smooth water. What use is it to have a charming wife, if you <br>
            cannot keep what you have got ? It is in vain you have locks <br>
            to your doors. While she embraces you, she sighs for other <br>
            absent loves, and suddenly feigns a head-ache. But intrust <br>
            her to my keeping; I do not refuse to endure stripes, I do <br>
            not object to have my feet put in fetters, if I let her escape. <br>
            Then keep off, all you who dress your hair with art, whose <br>
            tunics hang loose upon your breasts. Any man that comes <br>
            this way, to hinder all chance of his doing mischief, let him <br>
            keep off, and not stop until he is far away in another street.</p>
          <p>Thus the god himself commands it to be done; thus the <br>
            great priestess has conveyed to me the injunctions of the <br>
            divine oracle. Once she is agitated and distraught by the <br>
            impulse of Bellona, she fears neither scorching flame, nor <br>
            lashes; she lacerates her own arms with an axe, and unmur­ <br>
             <pb n="123"/>
            muringly sprinkles the goddess with her blood ; with a spike <br>
            thrust through her side, and her bosom torn, she stands, and. <br>
            chants the events which the great goddess foretells. " For­ <br>
            bear from assailing a girl whom Love guards, lest you be <br>
            afterwards taught a terrible lesson. Touch her, and your <br>
            wealth shall pass away, like the blood from my wounds, like <br>
            these ashes scattered by the winds." And on you, my Delia, <br>
            she denounced I know not what penalties: but if you receive <br>
            me, I will pray her to be light with you. I do not spare you <br>
            for your own sake ; but your mother moves me, and the ex­ <br>
            cellent old woman subdues my resentment. She brings you <br>
            to me in the dark, and mutely and in great fear joins our <br>
            hands together. She waits for me by night, fixed to the door, <br>
            and recognises the sound of my footstep a long way off. Long <br>
            may you live for me, sweet old woman: fain would I com­ <br>
            pound my own years with yours, were it possible. I will <br>
            always love you, and your daughter for your sake ; whatever <br>
            she does, she is, after all, your blood. Teach her only to be <br>
            chaste, though no fillet binds her hair, no long robe impedes <br>
            her feet.! And on me, too, let hard laws be imposed, nor let <br>
            it be possible for me to praise any beauty, unless she is before <br>
            my eyes. And if I am adjudged to have offended in any <br>
            way, and am pulled by the hair undeservedly, and am dragged <br>
            along the sloping street ; 2 let me not think of striking of you ; <br>
            but if such madness seizes me, I should wish myself without <br>
            hands. And be not chaste through fear alone, but let mutual <br>
            love keep you faithful in mind to me when I am absent. The <br>
            girl who was faithful to no lover, after age has overcome her, <br>
            sinks into want, and draws out the twisted threads with her <note type="footnote"> 1 Though no fillet, &amp;c.] The vitta and the stola were worn only by <br>

            Each individual had a separate Genius who regulated his lot, and was re­ <br>
            presented as black or white according to his fortunes. The Genius of <br>
            women was called a Juno. It was natural that the birthday should be <br>
            particularly set apart for the worship of the Genius, and that the marriage <br>
            bed should be under his special protection, and hence called genialis torus. <br>
            Genialis is used generally as an epithet for anything which conduces to <br>
            festivity, mirth, or pleasure. To practise abstinence is " to defraud one's <br>
            Genius on the other hand, " to indulge one's Genius " is to eat, drink, <br>

            public ways ranked among the most important works of Roman magnifi­ <br>
            cence. Amazing labour, with vast expense, were devoted and combined <br>
            in extending them from the capital to the utmost limits of the known <br>
            world ; and in many instances they seem to have been calculated by their <br>
            construction to outlast the empire, of which they have not inaptly beer <br>
            termed the arteries. Nor was their construction alone the object of soli­ <br>
            citude, the care of looking to their repair was not thought unworthy the <br>
            greatest men of the republic. None but those of the highest rank were <br>
            eligible to the office of superintending that service; and we find Augustus <br>
            himself taking the charge of a district. The Appian Way, the most an­ <br>
            cient as well as the most noble, being distinguished by the epithet regina <br>
            viarum, as originally made by Appius Claudius the censor, extended from <br>
            Rome to Capua. It was composed of three strata ; the lower of rough <br>
            stones or flint cemented together formed a foundation or-statumen ; the <br>
            middle stratum or rudera was of gravel; the upper of well-jointed stones <br>
            of irregular forms. It remains in many places perfect to the present <br>

          <p>IT cannot be concealed from me what import there is in a <br>
            lover's language of signs, and his softly-whispered words. <br>
            I have not the gift of sortilege, or of reading the secrets of <br>
            the gods in entrails; nor does the song of birds forewarn me <br>
            of things to come; but Venus, binding my arms behind me <br>
            with a magic knot, hath thoroughly instructed me, not without <br>
            many stripes.</p>
          <p>Cease to dissemble. The god of love burns more merci­ <br>
            lessly those whom he sees to have succumbed to him unwill­ <br>
            ingly. You, Marathon, have done this. What does it avail <br>
            you now to have bestowed such pains on your soft locks, and <br>
            to have so often changed their arrangement ? to have adorned <br>
            your cheeks with shining dye ? to have had your nails trim­ <br>
            med by the artist's skilful hand ? In vain are your garments <br>
            frequently changed, and your feet compressed in tight shoes. <br>
            3he charms though she comes with a face which she has taken <br>
            no pains to beautify, and though she has not spent much time <br>
            and art in dressing her shining head. Has an old woman be­ <br>
            witched you with incantations and potent herbs in the silent <br>
            time of night ? Incantations steal away the crops from the <br>
            fields; incantations stop the course of the enraged serpent; <br>
            incantations attempt to drag down the moon from her chariot, <br>
            and would do it, were it not for the sound of the clashing <br>
            brasses. But why do I accuse incantations of having worked <br>
            you woe ? Why do I talk of herbs ? Beauty has no need of <note type="footnote"> I Elegy IX.] Tibullus pleads the cause of his favourite Marathus, <br>
            who was ill-used by the coquette, Pholoë, and lectures the former on his <br>

            magic auxiliaries. The charm that is really noxious, is to <br>
            have touched the fair body, to have given long kisses, to have <br>
            been mutually entwined.</p>
          <p>Remember this, Pholoë, and be not unkind to the youth; <br>
            Venus punishes such misdeeds. Ask not for presents; let <br>
            the white-headed lover give presents, that you may warm his <br>
            frigid frame in your bosom. More precious than gold is a <br>
            youth with smooth shining face, and no rough beard to scrape <br>
            the bosom be embraces. Put your white arms beneath his <br>
            shoulder, and despise the treasures of kings. Venus will find <br>
            you opportunities to yield furtively to the ardent boy, when <br>
            he presses your tender bosom, and to give him moist kisses <br>
            with tilting tongue as he pants for breath, and to mark his <br>
            neck with your teeth.</p>
          <p>No joy can precious stones and jewels yield to her who <br>
            sleeps alone in the cold, and who is an object of desire to no <br>
            man. Alas, too late is love, too late is youth recalled, when <br>
            age has shed its whiteness on the head. Then is the <br>
            toilette a serious business; then are the locks tinctured and <br>
            changed with the green husk of the walnut, to disguise the <br>
            effect of years ; then what pains are taken to root out white <br>
            hairs, and to make the face cast its skin and be new again.</p>
          <p>But you whose life is in its blooming prime, use it while <br>
            you may; it is gliding away with no slow foot. And torture <br>
            not Marathus: what glory is there in smiting .a boy? Be <br>
            obdurate to the old; but spare the tender youth, I beseech <br>
            you. It is not bodily ailment, but excessive love, that tinges <br>
            his complexion with yellow. Poor lad! How often, when <br>
            you are far away, he pours out piteous complaints and sheds <br>
            no end of tears !</p>
          <p>“ Why does she scorn me?" he says. " The vigilance of <br>
            those who watch her might be defeated. The god of love <br>
            himself has given lovers the power of eluding restraint. I <br>
            know the arts of furtive Venus, how to breathe softly, and <br>
            how to snatch kisses without letting them be heard. I can <br>
            creep in noiselessly even in the dead of night, and open the <br>
            doors without the least sound. But what avail these arts, if <br>
            she spurns her wretched lover, and flies, cruel girl, from the <br>
            very bed in which I would embrace her ? Even when she <br>
            promises, with sudden perfidy she breaks her word, and I <br>
            must watch the livelong night in countless torments. While <br>
             <pb n="129"/>
            I delude myself with the thought that she will come, I think <br>
            every movement I hear is the sound of her steps. Ah, perish <br>
            all vain arts and observances of wooing! I will clothe my <br>
            squalid body in shaggy garments. If my girl's door is shut, <br>
            if I have few opportunities of seeing her, alas, what good does <br>
            it do an unfortunate wretch like me to wear a flowing toga?"</p>
          <p>Cease your tears, poor youth ; her hard heart is unmoved, <br>
            and your wearied eyes are swollen with weeping. The gods <br>
            hate disdain, I warn you, Pholoë, and those who are guilty of <br>
            it offer incense in vain at their holy altars. This Marathus <br>
            used formerly to mock unhappy lovers, not aware that an <br>
            avenging god was behind him. He is said even to have often <br>
            laughed at the tears of an anguished lover, and purposely to <br>
            have thrown obstacles in his way. Now he hates all arrogant <br>
            disdain ; now he loathes every door that is shut fast at night. <br>
            Your punishment too will come unless you cease to be haughty. <br>

          <p>WHY, if you were to wrong my wretched love, why did <br>
            you give me pledges in the name of the gods, which were to <br>
            be secretly broken? Ah! cruel one, though perjuries be at <br>
            first concealed, yet chastisement comes at last with noiseless <br>
            steps. Spare her, gods; it is just that the lovely should be <br>
            free once to break with impunity oaths sworn by your sacred <br>
            names. In hope of gain the husbandman yokes his bulls to <br>
            the plough, and plies the hard work of agriculture. In hope <br>
            of gain unstable ships are led by sure stars over seas that obey <br>
            the winds. My girl has been seduced by gifts: but may an <br>
            avenging god turn them into ashes and water. I shall soon <br>
            see her punished; dust shall disfigure her beauty; her hair <br>
            shall be roughened by the winds ; her face and her locks shall <br>
            be sun-burnt, and her delicate feet shall be way-worn.</p>
          <p>How often have I admonished you thus ! " Sully not your <br>
            loveliness for gold, countless ills often lurk beneath it. If any <br>
            one, beguiled by wealth, does violence to Love, Venus visits <br>

            lashes. Nor hope when you are about to sii that you can <br>
            conceal it: there is a god who will not let perfidy be hidden. <br>
            That god makes the taciturn confederate speak out freely <br>
            when he has drunk largely. That god compels dreamers to <br>

            shine in heaven, or that there was purity in the water of the <br>
            stream. You wept too; and I, unpractised in deceit, and <br>
            credulous, wiped your moist cheeks assiduously. How would <br>
            you treat me, were you not yourself in love ? 1 I pray that <br>

            the wars of Venus grow hot; a woman complains of locks <br>
            cut off her head, and of her doors broken open ; she weeps <br>
            and shows the bruises on her tender cheeks; and then the <br>
            victor himself weeps to think that his mad hands were so <br>
            strong. Meanwhile wanton Love suggests spiteful words to <br>
            swell the quarrel, and seats himself at his ease between the <br>
            angry pair. Ah, he must be stone or iron, who beats his own <br>
            girl; he brings down the swift vengeance of the gods from <br>
            heaven. Be it enough to cut off the fine hem of her robe ; to <br>
            undo the arrangement of her tresses ; to make her shed tears ; <br>
            thrice happy he whose anger has the power to make a gentle <br>
            girl weep. But whoever shall be guilty of ill usage with his <br>
            hands, let him carry shield and pike, and keep far aloof from <br>
            gentle Venus.</p>
          <p>Come to us, bounteous peace, holding ears of corn in thy <br>
            hand, whilst thy lap overflows with fruit.</p>

            Unfasten the yokes ; the oxen must now stand at the full man­ <br>

            thanks to the rural gods. I sing the country and the gods of <br>
            the country: under their instruction, mankind ceased to re* <br>
            lieve their hunger with acorns. They first taught how to <br>
            cover the little log-but with green thatch. They too are said <br>
            to have first taught bulls to serve under the yoke, and to have <br>
            put wheels to the cart. Then wild food was dressed; then <br>
            apples were grafted; then the fertile garden drank irrigating <br>
            waters; then the golden grape yielded its pressed juices to <br>
            the feet; and sober water was mingled with the care-dispel­ <br>
            ling liquor of the vine. The country yields harvests, when <br>
            the earth annually sheds its locks in the season of the hot star. <br>
            In the vernal country the light-winged bee gathers the spoil of <br>
            flowers in its hive, and busily fills its combs with sweet honey. <br>
            The husbandman, wearied with the continual labours of the <br>
            plough, first sang rustic words in determinate measure ; and <br>
            first modulated, after his repasts, on the dry oaten pipe, the <br>
            airs he prepared to sing before the adorned images of the gods. <br>
            The husbandman, with cheeks reddened with ochre, first led <br>
            thy unfashioned chorus, 0 Bacchus; a he-goat, the leader of <br>
            the flock, was given to him from the full fold-a notable re­ <br>
            ward.2 In the country the youth first wove crowns of flowers, <br>
            and placed them on the heads of his ancient Lares. In the <br>
            country too the bright-fleeced sheep bears on its back the <br>
            wool that is to be the care of the tender damsels. Hence is <br>
            derived the labour of the females in the household, the dis­ <br>
            taff clothed with wool, and the spindle that revolves under <note type="footnote"> 1 Rough-haired ancestors.] Barbers were unknown in Rome until four <br>

            flowing hair and long beards; Scipio Africanus is said to have first set <br>

            who sings as she busily plies the work of Minerva, and the <br>
            web sounds to the stroke of the lay.</p>
          <p>Cupid himself too issaid to have been born in the fields <br>
            among the herds and the unbroken mares. There he made <br>
            his first inexpert efforts with the bow: ah me ! what ex­ <br>
            pert hands he has now ! Nor does he take cattle for his <br>
            mark, as he did then; his delight is to transfix girls and to <br>
            bring down proud-spirited men. He strips the young man of <br>
            his wealth ; and constrains the old man to utter words that <br>
            disgrace him at the angry fair one's door. Led by him, the <br>
            girl steps furtively over the bodies of the sleeping watch, and <br>
            meets the youth alone in the dark. Timorously she treads the <br>
            ground on tiptoe, and gropes her blind way. Alas, unhappy <br>
            they whom the god severely persecutes; and happy lie on <br>
            whom kind Love breathes gently.</p>
          <p>Come, sacred boy, to our festive banquet; but lay aside thy <br>
            arrows, and hide far, far hence, thy glowing torch. Celebrate <br>
            the god, all of you, in song, and summon him with your <br>
            voices to the flock; let each summon openly to the flock, and <br>
            secretly to himself; or even openly each to himself, for the <br>
            jocund rout is boisterous, and the curved pipe dins in Phry­ <br>

            the yellow Stars are following the chariot of their mother in <br>

            after the example of Apollo, who in similar circumstances became the <br>
            herdsman of Admetus. So exasperated is he by the departure of his <br>
            mistress, that he curses his favourite pursuit of agriculture for having <br>
            caused it, and wishes for a return of the happy times when men fed on <br>

            in their anxiety, but found them not, and the crowd returned <br>
            home, frustrated, from the temple. Often did Latona grieve <br>
            to see the rough disorder of those sacred locks, which a step­ <br>
            dame herself had before admired. Whoever had seen that <br>

            where were the locks of Phoebus ? Where is thy Delos now, <br>

            were not ashamed to serve Venus. That love-smitten god is <br>
            now a common jest; but one to whom his mistress is dear, <br>
            would rather be a common jest than a god without love.</p>
          <p>But oh, cruel Ceres, who wilest away Nemesis from the city, <br>

            execrates her venality, but is ready to indulge it at all hazards. " The <br>
            whole poem," says Grainger, " is a tempest of amorous and contrary <br>
            affections. By these our author is particularly distinguished from Ovid <br>

            the same passion ; whereas the reader will often find in one of Tibullus's <br>
            all those contrarieties and transitions which peculiarly characterize the <br>
            passion of love, and are so beautiful in poetry. This justifies the elegant <br>

          <p>THY favour, Phœbus ! A new priest enters thy temple : <br>
            hither, come hither with harp and song; I entreat thee now <note type="footnote"> respecting this mysterious ingredient of witchcraft. Aristotle and The­ <br>
            ocritus mention a plant of that name, the smell of which made mares <br>
            turn mad for the stallion. Pliny says the hippomanes was a fig-like ex­ <br>
            crescence on the forehead of the new-born foal, which the dam immedi­ <br>
            ately bit off and swallowed; and if she was prevented, she would not let <br>
            the foal suck. Virgil, Georg. iii., agrees with Tibullus in making it a <br>
            liquid exudation. </note><note type="footnote"> I Elegy V.] The subject of this Elegy is the appointment of Messalinus, <br>
            Messala's eldest son, as one of the Quindecemviri, the fifteen priests of <br>
            Apollo, who had charge of the Sibylline books. " The Romans," says <br>
            Grainger, " were proud of being thought the posterity of the Trojans; <br>
            and their poets embraced every opportunity of making their court to the <br>
            people by adopting that notion. Nor was this prejudice confined to the <br>
            meaner sort of Romans; Julius Caesar, and his successor, either believed, <br>
            or affected from political motives to believe, that they were descendants <br>
            of Æneas. Nay, so far was this folly carried, that Augustus entertained <br>
            a design of transferring the seat of empire from.. Rome to Troy. This <br>
            the Romans dreaded not a little; and to such a height did their ap­ <br>
            prehensions increase, A. u. c. 734, when Augustus was in Syria, that Ho­ <br>
            race, all courtier as he was, is supposed to have written that noble ode, <br>
            Justum et tenacem, lib. iii. od. 5, obliquely to dissuade the emperor from <br>
            that measure. As this, however, was a very delicate subject, and none <br>
            knew better how to flatter his patron than Horace, he abruptly breaks off, <br>
            -non hæc jocosæ conveniunt lyræ : these things are unsuited to the <br>
            sportive lyre. Tibullus, however, not lying under the same obligations <br>
            to Augustus as the lyric poet, and neither courting the smiles nor dread­ <br>
            ing the frowns of the court, he, like a true patriot in all the enthusiasm <br>
            of poetry, introduces the Sibyl pushing on Æneas to the new settlement <br>
            destined by heayen for him and his followers in Italy. As Augustus pro­ <br>
            fessed a great veneration for the Sibylline books, and was anxious to be <br>
            thought the son pf Apollo, who, he said, fought for him at the battle of <br>
            Actium; the people (whose prejudices to the removing of their seat of <br>
            empire must have been augmented by our poet's well-timed prophecy) <br>
            would have regarded Augustus's breach of the Sibyl's orders as the most <br>
            impious of violations. Besides, so flagrant a disrespect, and in one too of <br>
            such eminence, might have produced the most fatal consequences to his <br>
            government, by weakening the reverence which his subjects entertained <br>
            for the Sibylline writings. This, Augustus was too sensible not to per­ <br>
            ceive, and too politicnot to avoid " </note> <br>

            aruspex forecasts the future, when a god has set marks on <br>
            the slippery entrails. Guided by thee, the Sibyl who sings <br>
            in hexameters the hidden things of fate, has never misled the <br>
            Romans. Phœbus, suffer Messalinus to touch the books of <br>
            the prophetess, and expound to him thyself, I beseech thee, <br>
            what she sings.</p>
          <p>She made known his destiny to Æneas, after, as the legend <br>
            tells, he bore off his father and his rescued Lares, nor thought <br>
            that Rome would be, when he looked back in sorrow from the <br>
            deep on Ilion and its burning gods. Romulus had not yet <br>
            formed the walls of the eternal city, in which his associate <br>
            Remus was not destined to dwell; but cows fed there on <br>
            the grassy Palatine, and humble cabins stood on the site of <br>
            Jove's citadel. Milk-swilling Pan lodged there under the <br>
            shade of the holm-oak, and wooden Pales carved with a rustic <br>
            bill-hook. The garrulous pipe, sacred to the woodland god, <br>
            hung on a tree, as the homage of the roving shepherd : the pipe, <br>
            in which the range of reeds decreases continually, for a smaller <br>
            tube is joined with wax to the first, and so on to the end. <br>
            But where the open region of the Velabrum2 extends, a little <br>
            boat used to ply over the water. In it the girl who was to <br>
            charm the rich master of the flock, was often ferried over to <br>
            the youth on festal days. Gifts of the fruitful country re­ <br>

          <p>“Intrepid Æneas,” sang the Sibyl, “brother of winged Love, <br>
            who carriest the sacred things of Troy in thy ships as thou <br>
            fliest, Jupiter now assigns to thee the Laurentian fields; that <br>
            hospitable land now invites thy wandering Lares. Troy will <br>
            then indeed marvel at itself, and own that thou hast done <br>
            wisely in traversing so long a way. There thou wilt be sanc­ <br>
            tified when the honoured water of Numicus1 shall have sent <br>
            thee to heaven as one of the Dii Indigetes. Lo, victory hovers <br>
            over thy wave-worn ships. At last the haughty goddess joins <br>
            the Trojans. Lo, the flames gleam before me in the camp of <br>
            the Rutuli; now I foretell death to thee, barbarian Turnus. <br>
            Before my eyes is the Laurentian camp and the wall of La­ <br>
            vinium, and Alba Longa founded by Prince Ascanius. Thee, <br>
            too, I see, priestess, who wilt charm Mars; Ilia, thou hast <br>
            deserted the altars of Vesta; I see your stealthy embraces, <br>
            and the fillets cast on the ground, and the arms of the ardent <br>
            god left on the shore. Pluck, bulls, the grass from the seven <br>
            mountains while now you may ; this will be the site of a great <br>
            city. Rome, thy name is destined by fate to rule the earth, <br>
            wherever Ceres looks down from heaven on her fields, from <br>
            where the rising of the sun is seen, to where his panting steeds <br>
            bathe in the restless waves. I sing true things: so may I <br>
            ever feed unharmed on the sacred laurel,2 and my virginity <br>

            were heard in the sky, and that the sacred groves predicted <br>
            flight. The cloudy year, too, saw the rayless sun yoke his pale <br>
            horses ; and the images of the gods shedding warm tears; and <br>
            heard oxen foretelling the fates with human voices.</p>
          <p>These things were of old ; but now, mild Apollo, sink such <br>
            portents beneath the tameless ocean; and may the lighted <br>
            laurel crackle well in the sacred fire, giving omen of a happy <br>
            and sacred year. Ho, the laurel bath given good tokens; <br>
            farmers, rejoice ! Ceres will distend the full granaries with <br>
            corn, and the rustic, tipsy with must, will tread the grapes <br>
            till cisterns and vats shall fail to hold the abundant liquor. <br>
            The shepherd bedewed by Bacchus shall celebrate his festival <br>
            of Pales ; then keep aloof from the stalls, ye wolves. Filled <br>
            with drink he will set fire solemnly to heaps of straw, and leap <br>
            through the sacred flames. And the matron will bear chil­ <br>
            dren, and the son will catch hold of his father by the ears <br>
            and kiss him; nor will the grandfather weary of watching <br>
            over his little grandson, and prattling broken words with the <br>
            child. Then the lads who have done service to the gods will <br>
            stretch themselves on the grass where falls the light shade of <br>
            an ancient tree. Or they will spread out their garments for <br>
            screens and tie them with flowery sprays; and a crowned <br>
            goblet shall stand before them. Each spreads a banquet for <br>
            himself, and erects, a table and a couch of turf.' There the <br>
            youth will fling spiteful words at his girl in his drink, which <br>
            he will soon wish unsaid ; for savage as he is just now, he will <br>
            weep when he is sober, and swear that he was not in his right <br>
            senses.</p>
          <p>So please thee, Phœbus, perish bows, perish arrows, only <br>
            let Love roam the earth unarmed. Good is the art of archery, <br>
            but since Cupid took up arms, alas, alas, to how many has <br>
            that art been woeful! And to myself especially, for I have <br>

            marl blasphemies.</p>
          <p>But come, whoever thou art, to whom Cupid is a grim­ <br>
            visaged commander, come to my tent and let us share the toils <br>
            of war together. This iron age prizes not Venus, but booty; <br>
            yet booty is won with many hardships. Booty hath girded <br>
            fierce ranks with hostile arms; hence comes bloodshed, and <br>
            slaughter, and expedited death. Booty impelled men to double <br>
            their dangers on the restless sea, when it put warlike prows <br>
            to insecure ships. He who fights for booty longs to possess <br>
            immense fields, that he may have countless flocks feeding <br>
            over multitudes of acres. He is anxious to procure foreign <br>
            stone; a column is carried to his mansion, amidst the con­ <br>
            fusion of the city, by a thousand strong pairs of oxen ; and a <br>
            mole locks in the tameless sea, that the fish at ease within it <br>
            may disregard the wintry billows. But let Samian pottery, <br>
            and plastic clay fashioned on the Cuman wheel, bear glad <br>
            cheer for you. Alas, alas, I see that our girls delight in <br>
            wealthy lovers. Come then spoil and plunder, if Venus <br>
            craves for opulence; that my Nemesis may swim in luxury, <br>
            and be made conspicuous by my presents as she walks through <br>
            the city. Let her wear thin robes spun by the Coan women <br>
            and inwoven with gold; let her be attended by dark-skinned <br>
            servants scorched in India, and blackened by the fire from <br>
            the near chariot of the sun; let Africa and Tyre vie in sup­ <br>
            plying her with their choicest colours, their purples of violet <br>
            and crimson tinge.</p>
          <p>I speak things notorious to all lovers: that fellow is now <br>
            royally installed, who was often forced to show his chalked <br>
            feet1 on the barbarian platform. <note type="footnote"> 1 Chalked feet.] Slaves imported from abroad, when they were ex­ <br>

          <p>I WOULD ere this have put an end to my woes by death; <br>
            but credulous hope cherishes life, and always says that to- <br>
            morrow will be better. Hope cheers the husbandman ; hope <br>
            commits the seed to the ploughed furrow, to be repaid by <br>
            the field with large interest. She catches birds with the <br>
            snare, and fishes with the rod, when the bait has previ­ <br>
            ously concealed the fine hooks. Hope consoles even the <br>
            slave who is fastened in strong fetters: the irons rattle on his <br>
            legs, yet he sings at his work. Hope assures me that Neme­ <br>
            sis will be kind; but she refuses. Oh, stubborn girl, be not <br>
            stronger than a goddess! Spare me, I implore you by the <br>
            bones and premature death of your sister; so may the little <br>
            one rest well beneath the gentle earth. She is sacred to me ; <br>
            I will offer gifts upon her tomb, and garlands wet with my <br>
            tears. I will fly to her tomb, and sit there a suppliant, and <br>
            complain of my fate to her mute dust. She will not suffer <br>
            me, her client, always to weep for your sake. I deprecate <br>
            her words, that you be kind to me, lest her neglected manes <br>
            send you bad dreams, and your sad sister stand before your <br>
            bed as you sleep, such in appearance as when, falling head­ <br>
            long from a high window, she went all bloody to the shades.</p>
          <p>I drop the subject, lest the bitter grief of my mistress be <br>
            renewed. I am not worth that she should weep once through <br>
            me; nor does she deserve that her speaking eyes should be <br>
            spoiled with tears. It is a bawd that injures me ; my girl <br>
            herself is good-natured. Phryne, the bawd, denies me ad­ <br>
            mittance, and goes backwards and forwards carrying notes <br>
            concealed in her bosom. Often when I hear sweet tones <br>
            from my mistress's hard threshold, that old wretch says she <br>
            is not at home. Often when a night has been promised me <br>
            she brings me word that my girl is ill, or that she is frightened <br>
            by some threatening events or other. Then I am mortally <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy VII.] The poet would long ago have ended his woes by death, <br>

          <p>HE was made of iron who first tore the beloved maid from <br>

            was he who could bear such grief, and survive the loss of his <br>
            mistress. I have not such fortitude; such power of endur­ <br>
            ance is not in my nature. Sorrow breaks even stout hearts. <br>
            Nor am I ashamed to speak the truth, and to confess my dis­ <br>
            gust for a life that has suffered so many woes. So when I <br>
            shall have been changed into a thin shade, and the black dust <br>
            shall cover my white bones, may Neæra with long dishevelled <br>
            hair come and weep before my funeral pile. But let her come <br>
            accompanied by her dear sorrowing mother; and let the one <br>
            mourn a son-in-law, the other a husband. Then having ad­ <br>

            when they have collected them, let them first sprinkle them <br>
            with old wine, then wash them with white milk; afterwards <br>
            soak the moisture from them with linen cloths, and lay them <br>
            dry in their marble home. Then be there poured upon them <br>

          <p>WHAT avails it, Nerera, to have wearied the gods with <br>
            vows, and to have offered them pleasing incense with many <br>
            prayers ? I have not done this that I might issue forth from <br>
            a marble mansion, as the distinguished scion of an illustrious <br>
            house; or that my oxen might till many acres of land, and <br>
            the kindly earth yield me large crops ; but that I might share <br>
            with you the joys of a long life, and that my age might sink <br>
            to rest on your bosom, when I should have completed my <br>
            allotted span of life, and should be compelled to be ferried <br>
            naked in the Lethæan boat. For what were I the better for <br>
            a vast weight of gold ? Or though a thousand oxen tilled my <br>
            fertile land ? What to me were a mansion supported on <br>
            Phrygian columns, or on those from your quarries, Tænarus <br>
            or Caristus ?2 Or to have in my house plantations resembling <br>
            sacred groves, and gilded beams, and a marble floor ? What <br>
            delight have I in cloths dyed with the shell collected on the <br>
            Red Sea's shore, or with the murex of Sidon, or in all the <br>
            things besides which the vulgar admire ? These things excite <br>

            A man's mind is not lightened or his cares removed by wealth, <br>

            thee I care for no gifts of kings. 0 brightly fair day, that <br>

          <p>MAY the gods grant me better things ; nor let those dreams <br>
            be true which hateful sleep presented to me last night. Avaunt, <br>
            dreams ; turn away your false, delusive faces, and expect no <br>
            longer to be believed. The gods give true warnings of com­ <br>

            true warnings; but idle dreams beguile us in the deceitful <br>

            thee as no daughter is to her mother, as no fair girl is to the <br>
            eager bridegroom; she for whom thou dost weary the gods <br>
            with vows, who suffers not thy days to pass in peace, and <br>
            who mocks thee with nightly visions when sleep has wrapped <br>
            thee in her sombre mantle; she who is celebrated in thy <br>
            songs, the beautiful Neæra, prefers to be the bride of another. <br>
            The unkind girl has her own amorous cares which arc not <br>
            for thee ; Neæra rejoices not in the thought of entering a pure <br>
            house as a bride. Ah, cruel sex! woman, faithless name! <br>
            All perish whosoever she be that has learned to betray a <br>
            lover's hopes ! But she may be bent; their minds are change­ <br>

            Harsh Love hath taught his votaries to perform stubborn <br>
            tasks ; harsh Love hath taught them to bear stripes. That <br>
            I once pastured the white herds of Admetus, is not a tale in­ <br>

            no necessary dependence on the context, but the latter would be improved <br>

            Here was I born: then rose my natal day, <br>

            the latter, who was so minutely communicative, should have omitted so <br>
            remarkable a fact, the mention of which would seem naturally prompted <br>
            by his esteem for Tibullus. But on the contrary he leaves us to suppose, <br>
            from a successive enumeration of poets, that Tibullus was considerably <br>
            his senior; and he regrets that fate had not allowed him to cultivate his <br>
            friendship. Moreover the chronology which these lines would establish, <br>
            can by no means be reconciled with various known events of our poet's <br>
            life. For instance, it would show him to have been only thirteen or <br>
            fourteen years of age when he bore a distinguished part in his patron <br>
            Messala's victorious campaign in Gaul. Tibullus fell sick at Corcyra on <br>
            his voyage with Messala to Syria, which was undertaken at the latest in <br>
            726 (B. c. 28); and it appears from the Elegy which he wrote on that oc­ <br>
            casion that he must have been for some time the favoured lover of Delia. <br>
            That Elegy is one of his most successful compositions, and his precocity <br>
            is unexampled, if before reaching the age of sixteen, he had earned all <br>
            these triumphs in war, and love, and poetry. Lastly, Horace must have <br>
            jeen forty when he wrote the Epistle in which he compliments Tibullus as <br>
            the candid critic of his satirical and epistolary " discourses: " a very un­ <br>

            out springs of fresh water; how the approach may be made <br>
            easy for thy own men, and difficult for the enemy, and how <br>
            the soldier may be kept in vigour by continual rivalry for <br>
            praise; who best casts the heavy javelin or the light arrow, <br>
            or bursts through impediments with the stiff pike; who can <br>
            restrain the swift steed with a tight rein, or throw the reins <br>
            loose to the slow one, and urge the animal straight forward, <br>
            or compel it to wheel round in a narrow circle; who excels <br>
            with the shield, in guarding right or left, whether the shock <br>
            of the spear come this way or that; or in hitting the mark <br>
            with the sling. When comes the strife of bold Mars, and the <br>
            adverse lines prepare to meet, then thy promptitude is seen in <br>
            forming the order of battle, whether it is requisite that the <br>
            forces should be drawn up in a square with a long and even <br>
            front, or in two wings, so that the right, should attack the <br>
            enemy's left, the left his right, and that the two should achieve <br>
            a double victory. Nor does my song praise at random; for <br>
            I state things prowed in war: witness for me the brave soldier <br>
             <pb n="160"/>
            of the vanquished Iapydia; witness the crafty Pannonian, <br>
            everywhere driven back into the cold Alps ; and witness that <br>
            poor Arupinian, a soldier born, to see whom, so unbroken by <br>
            age, might make one wonder less at Pylian Nestor's reputed <br>
            three centuries. For though the old man may have seen <br>
            Titan bring back a hundred fruitful years, yet he will spring <br>
            boldly on a swift courser's back, and govern him with the <br>
            reins. Under thy command the horse-taming nation, that <br>
            never turned their backs before, bent their free necks to the <br>
            Roman chain.</p>
          <p>Nor shalt thou be content with these things ; for greater <br>
            are at hand, as I have ascertained by veracious auguries such <br>
            as Melampus son of Amythaon1 could not surpass. Thou <br>
            hadst just put on a garment shining with Tyrian woof at the <br>
            dawn of the day that led in the fertile years; when the Sun <br>
            rose brighter out of the waves, and the discordant winds held <br>
            their rude breath, nor did the sinuous streams run their ac­ <br>
            customed course ; even the stormy sea was calm, no bird <br>
            swept through the air, no rough quadruped depastured the <br>
            dense woods, when deep silence was afforded for the hearing <br>
            of thy wishes. Jupiter himself came in his light chariot <br>
            through the empty air, left the heaven-touching top of Olym­ <br>
            pus, lent an attentive ear to thy prayers, and assented to <br>
            them all with his infallible nod. The fire applied to the altar <br>
            shone out joyously above the heaped brands. Begin then <br>
            with divine encouragement to do great deeds ; be thy triumphs <br>
            unlike those of others. Neighbouring Gaul will not be able <br>
            to withstand thee in war, nor the bold warriors of broad Spain; <br>
            nor the wild land possessed by the Tyrian colonists, nor those <br>

            men to the rising sun, hold their inhuman banquets; 2 nor <br>
            the Getæ, whose country is watered by the Hebrus, the Tanai's, <br>
            and the Mosynos. Why dwell on details ? Far as Oceanus <br>
            bounds the habitable globe with his waters, there is no region <br>
            which will stand against thee in arms. The Briton, yet un­ <br>
            conquered by Roman warfare, awaits thee, and the other part <br>
            of the world beyond the course of the sun. For the earth is <br>
            seated in the midst of the ambient air, and its whole orb is <br>
            divided into five parts; and two of these are always made <br>
            waste by icy cold. There the ground is always covered with <br>
            thick mist, and the flowing wave is arrested in its course by <br>
            frost, and stiffens into dense ice and snow; for Titan has <br>
            never carried his beams above those regions. But the middle <br>
            region is always exposed to the heat of Phoebus, whether he <br>
            approaches nearer the earth in his summer orbit, or hurries <br>
            swiftly through the short days of winter. There therefore <br>
            the earth is not thrown up by the ploughshare, nor does it <br>
            yield corn-crops or fodder. Neither Bacchus nor Ceres blesses <br>
            the fields, nor do animals inhabit the scorched region. Be­ <br>
            tween it and the cold regions are placed the two fertile zones, <br>
            our own and that which is opposite to it. Both these are <br>
            tempered alike by the climate that adjoins them on either <br>
            hand, in such wise that the one climate counteracts the other. <br>
            Hence the year revolves for us through mild seasons; hence <br>
            the bull has learned to submit his neck to the yoke, and the <br>
            flexible vine to ascend the lofty branches of the elm; the <br>
            annual crop yields mature harvests, the earth is cleft with <br>
            steel, the sea with the keel, and towns arise with walls of <br>
            masonry. So when thy deeds shall have marched through <br>
            new triumphs, thou alone wilt be declared the greatest in the <br>
            two worlds.</p>
          <p>I am not adequate to the heralding of such glory, not <br>
            though Phœbus himself should dictate to me the strains I <br>
            should sing. Thou hast Valgius, who may gird himself up <br>
            for this great effort; no one comes nearer than he to immortal <br>
            Homer. I too will not be idle, but will devote my labour to <note type="footnote"> 1The Araxes for boundary.] Tomyris, queen of the Scythians, de. <br>

            thy praises, though Fortune, adverse to me, impairs my powers, <br>
            as is her wont. For whereas of old my house shone with <br>
            great wealth, I had yellow crops to enrich granaries that were <br>
            too small for my exuberant harvests, and vast flocks and herds <br>
            feeding on the hills, plenty for their master, and too much for <br>
            thieves and wolves ; now regret remains ; for my grief is re­ <br>
            newed as often as sad memory recalls the years that are past. <br>
            But though worse befall, and I am despoiled of what is left, <br>
            my Muses will not fail to celebrate thee. Nor shall Pierian <br>
            honours alone be paid to thee ; for thee I would dare to go <br>
            through the wild waves, though the wintry billows swell be­ <br>
            neath the winds ; for thee I would stand alone in the thick of <br>
            battle, or cast my small body into the flames of AEtna. All I <br>
            am is thine; if then thou hast a little regard for me ; be it as <br>
            much or as little as thou wilt, if it be but at all; the Lydian <br>
            realm or the fame of Gylippus' were not more precious to <br>
            me, nor would I choose in preference the ability to write <br>
            books like Homer's. But if this poem of mine, the whole or <br>
            a part of it, be either well approved or slightly skimmed by <br>
            thee, no Fates shall put an end to my poetic laudations of <br>
            thee. Even when the tomb shall have covered my bones; <br>
            whether my death is near at hand, or a long life remains for <br>
            me; should I be transformed, and range the solid plains as a <br>
            horse, or become a bull, the glory of the slow herd, or as a <br>
            bird be wafted with wings through the liquid air, whatever <br>
            human form I may assume again after a long lapse of time, <br>
            I will add new poems in thy praise to those I have begun.</p>

          <p>SPARE my dear youth, boar that rangest the good pastures <br>
            of the plain, or the intricacies of the shady mountain ; be it <br>
            of no avail for thee to have whetted thy hard teeth for fight, <br>
            but may Love preserve him safe for me. But Diana and the <br>
            chase drive all thoughts of me from his mind. Oh perish the <br>
            forests and the hounds ! What infatuation to wish to hurt <br>
            your soft hands in enclosing thick-wooded hills with toils ! <br>
            What pleasure is it to creep stealthily into the lairs of wild <br>
            beasts, and scar your white legs with hooked brambles ? Yet <br>
            that I might roam with you, Cerinthus, I myself would carry <br>
            the twisted nets through the mountains. I myself would <br>
            track the steps of the swift stag, and loose the iron chains <br>
            from the hound. Then, then would the forests please me, <br>
            though I be convicted of lying down with you, light of my <br>
            eyes, before the very toils. Then let the boar come to them ; <br>
            he shall escape unhurt, rather than he shall disturb the joys of <br>
            eager Venus. Now let there be no Venus without me; but, <br>
            obedient to Diana's law, spread the nets, chaste youth, with <br>
            chaste hands. And whosoever shall surreptitiously trespass <br>
            upon my delight, may she fall into the grasp of wild beasts <br>
            and be torn to pieces. But you, Cerinthus, leave the chase <br>

            sweeter than the city ? Is a villa a fit place for a girl ? And <br>
            the cold Arnus in the Aretine district ? Now stay here, <br>
            Messala, who indeed are too importunately anxious about me, <br>
            and too often ready to take me on an unseasonable journey. <br>
            Carried hence, I leave my soul and my senses behind me, <br>
            since you will not let me exercise my own will.</p>

            A fearful quantity of rhymes. <br>
            I think a thousand lines, ay ten, <br>

            Not written upon foolscap base, <br>
            To blot, and alter, and erase ; <br>
            On royal paper smooth and fine <br>
            He pens at once the perfect line ; <br>

            And silver clasp, and silken clew, <br>
            Its shape by rule exactly right, <br>
            And all with highest polish bright. <br>

            Such different lights to those will show him <br>
            Who see himself, or read his poem.</p>
          <p>What title can this creature fit, <br>
            Who now appears a very wit, <br>
            Or aught, if ever aught arises, <br>

            No blazing hearth thy house to fire.</p>
          <p>Thou feed'st thy father and his wife, <br>

          </ab>
          <p>BORNE swiftly o'er the seas to Phrygia's woody strand, <br>
            Atys with rapid haste infuriate leap'd to land; <br>
            Where high-inwoven groves in solemn darkness meet, <br>
            Rush'd to the mighty deity's remote and awful seat, <br>
            And wilder'd in his brain, fierce inspiration's prey, <br>
            There with a broken flint he struck his sex away.</p>
          <p>Soon as he then beheld his comely form unmann'd, <br>
            While yet the purple blood flow'd reeking on the land <br>
            Seized in his snowy grasp the drum, the timbrel light, <br>
            That still is heard, dread Cybele, at thine initiate rite, <br>
            And struck the quivering skin, whence hollow echoes flew, <br>
            And raised this panting song to his infuriate crew.</p>
          <p>" Ye priests of Cybele, or rather let me say, <br>
            For ye are men no longer, ye priestesses, away ! <br>
            Together pierce the forest, great Cybele's domains, <br>
            Ye vagrant flocks of her on Dindymus who reigns. <br>
            Ye, like devoted exiles, who, seeking foreign lands, <br>
            Have follow'd me your leader, have bow'd to my commands ; <br>
            Have cross'd the salt-sea wave, have dared the raging storms, <br>
            And, loathing woman's love, unmann'd your lusty forms; <br>
            The sense of error past let laughing frenzy blind; <br>
            Let doubt, let thought itself be driven from the mind. <br>
            Haste, haste, together haste to Cybele divine ! <br>
            Seek we her Phrygian grove and dark sequester'd shrine, <br>
             <pb n="233"/>
            Where cymbals clash, where drums resound their deepening <br>
            tone, <br>
            Where Phrygia's crooked pipe breathes out its solemn drone, <br>
            Where votaresses toss their ivy-circled brows, <br>
            And urge with piercing yells their consecrated vows, <br>
            Where the delirious train disport as chance may lead: <br>
            Thither our vows command in mystic dance to speed."</p>
          <p>Thus Atys, female now, to female comrades sung. <br>
            The frantic chorus rose from many a panting tongue; <br>
            He-echoes the deep timbrel, the hollow cymbals ring, <br>
            And all to verdant Ida run madly as they sing. <br>
            Though breathless, still impetuous with inspiration's force, <br>
            Raving and bewilder'd, scarce conscious of her course, <br>
            As the unbroken heifer will By the threaten'd yoke, <br>
            Atys through gloomy woods, where never sun-beam broke, <br>
            Loud-striking the light timbrel, rush'd on with bounding stride, <br>
            And all the frantic priestesses pursue their rapid guide. <br>
            The fearful fane at length their panting ardour stops, <br>
            Each, faint and unrefresh'd, in leaden slumber drops. <br>
            In languor most profound their eyelids are deprest, <br>
            And all ecstatic rage is lull'd in torpid rest.</p>
          <p>But when again the sun returning to the skies <br>
            Put forth his golden brow, when now his radiant eyes <br>
            Throughout white heaven, and earth, and ocean pour'd their <br>
            light, <br>
            And with thunder-pacing steeds he chased the shades of night, <br>
            Sleep then leaving Atys, who started from her rest, <br>
            To fair Pasithea fled, and sunk upon her breast. <br>
            When slumber's reign serene had frenzy's flame subdued ; <br>
            When Atys her fell deed in clearer reason view'd, <br>
            Beheld in what abode her future lot was placed, <br>
            And, ah ! how low she stood in nature's rank disgraced ; <br>
            Then, hurried to despair by passion's rising tide, <br>
            Again she wildly sought the country's sea-girt side ; <br>
            There, casting her full eyes o'er boundless ocean's flow, <br>
            Address'd her native land in plaintive words of woe.</p>
          <p>" My country, oh my mother! creatress, parent earth ! <br>
            My country, oh my nurse that fed me from my birth ! <br>
            From whom, as churlish slaves their kindly lord have fled, <br>
            To Ida's gloomy wood an exile I have sped, <br>
             <pb n="234"/>
            With beasts their frozen dens for my abode to share. <br>
            And madly roaming rouse the fierce one from his lair. <br>
            Ah ! where, in what far point of this surrounding sky, <br>
            Shall I now deem, my native land, thy loved shores lie? <br>
            My longing eyeballs strain to cast their sight to thee, <br>
            While yet awhile my mind is from its frenzy free. <br>
            Must I for dreary woods forsake my native shore, <br>
            And see my friends, my home, my parents never more ? <br>
            No more the Forum seek, the gay Palestra's court, <br>
            The Stadium, urge no more each famed gymnastic sport ? <br>
            O wretched, wretched man ! while years shall slowly roll <br>
            For ever o'er and o'er again, grieve, grieve, my soul!</p>
          <p>" What grace, what beauty is there, that I did not enjoy ? <br>
            I, when in manhood's prime, a youth, or yet a boy, <br>
            The flower of all who trod the firm gymnastic soil, <br>
            The victor 'mid the crowd who wore the wrestler's oil. <br>
            My gates were ever thronged, and full my threshold swarm'd ; <br>
            With blooming garlands hung, that lovesick maidens form'd; <br>
            My mansion gaily glittered each morning as I sped <br>
            At earliest blush of sunrise with lightness from my bed.</p>
          <p>" And must I ever now a maniac votaress rave, <br>
            Heaven's devoted handmaid, to Cybele a slave, <br>
            Her frantic orgies ply, disgraced in nature's plan, <br>
            A part of what I was, a maim'd, a barren man ; <br>
            And dwell in Ida's caves which snow for ever chills ; <br>
            And pass my savage life on Phrygia's rugged hills, <br>
            Placed with the sylvan stag, the forest-ranging boar ? <br>
            Oh! now how soon I rue the deed, how bitterly deplore !"</p>
          <p>As from her rosy lips these wandering murmurs broke, <br>
            They rose to heaven and bore th' unwonted words she spoke <br>
            Indignantly unyoking her lions on the plain, <br>
            And rousing the grim beast that bore the left-hand rein, <br>
            Great Cybele, enraged, her dread injunction told ; <br>
            And thus to fury waked the tyrant of the fold.</p>
          <p>" Haste, fierce one, haste away! rush on with glaring ire ; <br>
            With inspiration's rage, with frenzy's goad of fire, <br>
            Drive the too-daring youth, who would my service <unclear>ny</unclear>, <br>

            So spake terrific Cybele, and loosed her lion's rein. <br>
            Gladly the beast awakes his ruthlessness of mind, <br>
            Bounds, rages, reckless leaves the thicket crush'd behind, <br>
            Then swiftly gained the beach, washed by the foamy flood, <br>
            Where Atys in despair amid the breakers stood, <br>
            And springing fiercely forth-the wretch, no longer brave, <br>
            Into the forest plunged, and in a living grave <br>
            There pass'd her long devoted life, a priestess and a slave.</p>

          <p>ATYS o'er the distant waters, driving in his rapid, bark, <br>
            Soon with foot of wild impatience touched the Phrygian forest <br>
            dark, <br>
            Where amid the awful shades possessed by mighty Cybele, <br>
            In his zealous frenzy blind, <br>
            And wand'ring in his hapless mind, <br>
            With flinty knife he gave to earth the weights that stamp <br>
            virility. <br>
            Then as the widow'd being saw its wretched limbs bereft of <br>
            man, <br>
            And the unaccustom'd blood that on the ground polluting ran, <br>
            With snowy hand it snatch'd in haste the timbrel's airy <br>

            With Atys, with Atys distractedly roam ; <br>
            Who your limbs have unmann'd in a desperate hour, <br>
            With a frantic disdain of the Cyprian power; <br>
            Who have carried my sect through the dreadful salt sea, <br>

            No delay, no delay, <br>
            But together away, <br>
            And follow me up to the Dame all-compelling, <br>
            To her high Phrygian groves, and her dark Phrygian <br>
            dwelling, <br>
            Where the cymbals they clash, and the drums they resound, <br>
            And the Phrygian's curved pipe pours its meanings around ; <br>
            Where the ivy-crown'd priestesses toss with their brows, <br>

            Where they shriek, and they scour, and they madden about,­ <br>
            'Tis there we go bounding in mystical rout."</p>
          <p>No sooner had spoken <br>
            This voice half-broken, <br>
            When suddenly from quivering tongues arose the universal cry. <br>
            The timbrels with a boom resound, the cymbals with a clash <br>
            reply, <br>
            And up the verdant Ida with a quicken'd step the chorus flew, <br>
            While Atys with the timbrels' smite the terrible procession <br>
            drew ; <br>
            Raging, panting, wild, and witless, through the sullen shades <br>
            it broke, <br>
            Like the fierce, unconquer'd heifer bursting from her galling <br>

            And on pursue the sacred crew, till at the door of Cybele, <br>
            Faint and fasting, down they sink, in pale immovability: <br>

            But when the Sun look'd out with eyes of light <br>
            Found the firm earth, wild seas, and skies of morning white, <br>
            Scaring the lingering shades <br>

            Sleep took his flight from Atys, hurrying <br>

            To memory woke and to collected madness.- <br>
            Struck with its loss, with what it was, and where, <br>
            Back trod the wretched being in despair <br>
            To the sea-shore, and stretching forth its eye <br>
            O'er the wide waste of waters and of sky, <br>
            Thus to its country cried with tears of misery:­</p>

            Fain, while my wits a little space are free, <br>

            Half of myself, sexless,-a sterile man ? <br>
            And must I feel, with never-varied woes, <br>
            The overhanging winter of these mountain snows, <br>
            Skulking through ghastly woods for evermore, <br>
            Like the lean stag, or the brute vagrant boar ? <br>

            And springs precipitous:—the wretch as fast, <br>

            The chosen strength of all the youth of Greece, <br>
            Resolved to plunder Colchos of its fleece, <br>
            In their swift vessel braved the salt domain, <br>
            And swept with oars of fir its azure plain; <br>

            (For them the goddess, whose proud empire frowns <br>

            Strange forms arose amid the tossing spray, <br>
            Sea-Nereids wondering at the monster's way. <br>
            For two succeeding suns the gallant crew, <br>

            Then Peleus first with love for Thetis burn'd, <br>
            Nor Thetis then a mortal bridegroom spurn'd ; <br>
            Then Jove himself, to whom all nature bows, <br>
            Deem'd Peleus worthy a celestial spouse.</p>
          <p>Oh ! born in that proud day, that age of earth <br>
            Most blest, hail, heroes ! hail, of heavenly birth ! <br>
            Hail, mighty bark, that like a mother bore <br>
            The living host enwomb'd from shore to shore ! <br>
            Ye I '11 invoke ; ye shall my verse address ; <br>
            And Peleus, thee, whom glorious spousals bless, <br>
            Thessalia's shield, to whom all-powerful Jove <br>
            Yielded the fair himself had sought with love : <br>
            Thetis, of all the offspring of the sea <br>
            The loveliest nymph, bestows her love on thee ; <br>
            Ocean, who earth encircles with his tide, <br>
            And Tethys, give their grandchild as thy bride.</p>
          <p>At length the weary interval was spent <br>
            'Twixt love's avowal and its full content. <br>
            Thessalia's crowds with gifts the palace seek, <br>
            And looks of greater joy than words can speak. <br>
            The throng from Tempe's vale, from Scyros roams, <br>
            From Cranon's turrets and Larissa's homes, <br>
            And seek from every side the rich Pharsalian domes. <br>
            The earth's untill'd, the bullock's callous throat, <br>
            Free from the yoke, regains its softer coat:</p><pb n="240"/>
            
          <p>The lowly vineyard knows no weeding rakes, <br>
            Nor ox with sloping share the furrow breaks : <br>
            No pruner lops the trees' encumbering boughs, <br>
            And rust grows thick on the neglected ploughs. <br>
            But through the halls of Peleus' vast abode <br>
            Pale silver shone, or gold more warmly glow'd ; <br>
            Thrones white with ivory, tables rich with plate; <br>
            The dome all gladden'd with its regal state. <br>
            'Twas in the central chamber had been spread <br>
            For her, the bride divine, the nuptial bed ; <br>
            Of Indian ivory form'd, it shunn'd the eye, <br>
            Veil'd by its covering of the crimson dye. <br>
            On that were pictured men and times of old,- <br>
            And wondrous art the deeds of heroes told. <br>
            There Ariadne, whose distracted soul <br>
            Felt every passion that defies control, <br>
            From Dia's coast, where foaming billows beat, <br>
            On Theseus gazed and his receding fleet. <br>
            She scaree believes, though sleep beguiles no more, <br>
            Though waking sense beholds the lonely shore, <br>
            That she, so lately to her Theseus dear, <br>
            Can be the wretched maid forsaken here. <br>
            But he, the treacherous youth, spreads all his sails, <br>
            And gives his vows of love to passing gales. <br>
            Him Minos' daughter, left to weep alone,, <br>
            Like some wild Bacchant's form in sculptured stone <br>
            Looks on afar from ocean's barren side, <br>
            While anguish heaves her with its silent tide. <br>
            No more the fillet wreaths her locks of gold ; <br>
            Her snowy bosom no light garments fold, <br>
            Nor the thin laces of the girdle bind <br>
            Her swelling breast that scarce will be confined: <br>
            Before her feet the scattered vestments fall, <br>
            And restless surf is sporting with them all. <br>
            She nor her fillet heeds, nor floating vest : <br>
            Theseus, on thee alone her turbid breast, <br>
            Her tearful eyes, her thoughts are all engrost, <br>
            And every sense is in thy falsehood lost.</p>
          <p>Ah how thy mind was madden'd, hapless fair! <br>
            By the keen woes that Venus planted there, <br>
             <pb n="241"/>
            When <unclear>cruel</unclear> Theseus from th' Athenian road <br>
            Sail'd to proud Crete, thy tyrant sire's abode. <br>
            For Athens, forced by pestilence's reign <br>
            To dire atonement for Androgens slain, <br>
            Took from her sons the glories of the race, <br>
            Cull'd from her virgin train the flower and grace, <br>
            And to the Minotaur desponding bore <br>
            Recurring banquets on her native gore. <br>
            When Theseus learnt his noble country's woes, <br>
            Peril and painful death he rather chose, <br>
            Than still to see from Athens sadly led <br>
            These woeful funerals of the living dead. <br>
            Swiftly with pleasant gales his vessel gain'd <br>
            The sea-girt realm where awful Minos reign'd ; <br>
            There with enraptured eyes the royal maid, <br>
            There Ariadne first his form survey'd. <br>
            Her bed yet breathed its fragrance o'er her charms <br>
            To lull them chastely in a mother's arms, <br>
            Pure as the myrtle on Eurotas' side <br>
            That draws its limpid nurture from the tide, <br>
            Or as the flower, whose varied colours blow <br>
            Warm'd by the breath of spring with all their glow. <br>
            Now, ere she turn'd away her doting sight, <br>
            Her eyes were glistening with impassion'd light; <br>
            Her breast was heated with the fiercest flame, <br>
            And springing pulses throbb'd o'er all her frame.</p>
          <p>O maddener of the mind ! immortal boy, <br>
            Whose power still blends with woe our richest joy ! <br>
            0 beauty's goddess ! 0 celestial queen <br>
            Of Golgos rugged and Idalia green ! <br>
            With what wild storms ye toss'd that virgin's breast, <br>
            Who sigh'd whene'er she met the fair-hair'd guest <br>
            What chilling terror made her heart-blood cold ; <br>
            How sicklier far her cheek than pallid gold, <br>
            When Theseus, burning the fell brute to tame, <br>
            Sought instant death or everlasting fame ! <br>
            Rich gifts in secret to the gods she vow'd <br>
            To gain the wish she dared not breathe aloud : <br>
            Those pious offerings could another save. <br>
            But vainly sought the bliss of her who. gave. <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>
             </p>
          <p>For a, the whirlwind hurls from Taurus' brow <br>
            The oak, and twists like reeds each giant bough. <br>
            Or thick with cones the oozy pine will tear; <br>
            And whirl the massive trunk aloft in air: <br>
            Far from the broken roots it falls to ground, <br>
            And scatters crashing devastation round : <br>
            So Theseus down the ponderous monster cast, <br>
            Who vainly raging gored the passing blast. <br>
            Thence back the victor bent his cautious tread, <br>
            Led through the labyrinth by a slender thread, <br>
            Which marked those tortuous paths, that thought in vain <br>
            Had toil'd to. trace, or memory to retain. <br>
            But why in long digression need I tell <br>
            The further fortune that the fair befell ? <br>
            Who from a sister's arms, a father's eye, <br>
            And e'en a mother's dear embrace could fly, <br>
            (Ah ! mother doom'd with flowing tears to moan !) <br>
            And gave up all for Theseus' love alone. <br>
            Nor need I tell, how the swift vessel bore <br>
            The pair to Dia's isle ; how from that shore <br>
            The traitor fled, while sleep her eyelids prest, <br>
            And lull'd her senses in unkindly rest. <br>
            Then, as with burning pangs she madly grieved, <br>
            Oft piercing shrieks her bursting heart relieved : <br>
            Often she climb'd the craggy cliff to gain <br>
            A larger prospect o'er the boundless main ; <br>
            Then rush'd, her ankles naked to the breeze, <br>
            Amid the breakers of repelling seas, <br>
            And there with half-drawn sighs, and meanings faint, <br>
            And streaming eyes, pour'd forth this wild complaint.</p>
          <p>" And hast thou, Theseus, on this desert strand <br>
            Left her, who fled for thee my native land; <br>
            And has thy double perfidy beguiled <br>
            The trusting father to betray the child ? <br>
            Darest thou, in scorn of heaven's attested host, <br>
            Bear fated perjury to thy native coast ? <br>
            Could nothing cheek the deed thy soul design'd; <br>
            Did rising pity never touch thy mind; <br>
            Nor e'er thy bosom to itself pourtray <br>
            Those burning pangs that now make mine their prey ? <br>
             <pb n="243"/>
            Not these thy promises so fondly vow'd, <br>
            When all affections to thine accent bow'd : <br>
            Thou never bad'st me hope a fate like this, <br>
            But festive spousals and connubial bliss. <br>
            The oaths thy passion urged thee then to swear <br>
            Are now all scattered to the senseless air. <br>
            Then let no woman hence in man believe, <br>
            Or think a lover speaks but to deceive. <br>
            He, while ungratified desire is high, <br>
            Shrinks from no oath, no promise will deny ; <br>
            Soon as his lust is satiate with its prize, <br>
            He spurns his vows and perjury's curse defies. <br>
            I snatch'd thee, lost, from death's ingulfing wave, <br>
            I rather doomed my brother to the grave, <br>
            Than fail in peril's desperate hour to aid <br>
            Thee, hard and false; and I am thus repaid ; <br>
            Am giv'n to beasts a prey; nor shall remorse <br>
            Heap e'en the rudest grave upon my corse.</p>
          <p>" What lonely lioness thy childhood fed, <br>
            What raging sea disgorged, what quicksand bred, <br>
            What vast Charybdis, or what Scylla stern ; <br>
            Who mak'st for life preserved such fell return ? <br>
            Though by the will of thy harsh father tied <br>
            Thou couldst not wed, and hail me as thy bride; <br>
            Thou might'st have borne me to thy native soil, <br>
            And I, thine handmaid, plied my pleasing toil; <br>
            O'er thy fair feet the tepid stream have shed, <br>
            And smoothed the purple covering of thy bed.</p>
          <p>" But, ah ! has grief subdued my tortured mind, <br>
            Or why complain I to the reckless wind; <br>
            Which with no sense endowed, no feeling warm, <br>
            Nor hears my utterance, nor can answer form ? <br>

            My father's threshold, a perfidious guest! <br>
            Lost as I am, what path, what hopes remain ? <br>
            Shall I my native mountains seek again ? <br>
            Ah ! the wide depth of ocean's pathless roar <br>
            Bars my approach ; and dare I hope once more <br>
            My sire's affection, whom I left to wed <br>
            The reeking murderer of my brother dead ? <br>
            Can love's sweet musings any solace give, <br>
            Or pictured truth, or promised rapture live ; <br>
            When the dear youth, on whom this heart relied, <br>
            Forsakes my bed and flies o'er yonder tide ? <br>
            No home, no busy cots around me smile, <br>
            And seas confine me to this hapless isle. <br>
            No means, no hope of flight, no living breath, <br>
            All round is desert, but all big with death.</p>
          <p>" But yet, ere fate shall close my languid eye, <br>
            Ere from my woe-worn breast my senses fly ; <br>
            I from the gods some ample curse will claim <br>
            On him who outraged their attested name ; <br>
            Will still, betray'd, invoke their awful power, <br>
            And pray for vengeance in my latest hour.</p>

            Paint on the threatening brow the hell-born breast, <br>
            Haste, hither haste, and hear my fell request. <br>
            'Tis helpless frenzy, senseless, blind despair ; <br>

            Till Theseus curse alike himself and all his race."</p>
          <p>As from her burning breast this prayer she pour'd, <br>

            Earth and wild ocean trembled, and on high <br>
            The glistening stars were shaken in the sky. <br>
            Then dark oblivion every thought supprest <br>
            Which Theseus yet had treasured in his breast: <br>
            Of the fond precepts he had long revered <br>
            He kept no memory, and no sign he rear'd, <br>
            No wish'd-for signal, that his sire might learn <br>
            His glorious triumph and his safe return.</p>

            While these weak eyes of fastly-dying flame <br>

            Soon as these hills once more thine eyes shall hail, <br>

          <p>Theseus had kept these words in memory bright <br>
            'Mid peril's turmoil, and through love's delight; <br>
            Now light as clouds, when tempests rudely sweep <br>
            The sky-hid summit of some frozen steep, <br>
            They fled his mind, nor bless'd the prosperous time <br>
            Forgot in safety's hour and victory's prime. <br>
            Wearing with constant tears his eager sight, <br>
            His sire still watch'd upon the rampart's height. <br>
            Saw the dark sails the clear horizon stain, <br>
            Madden'd with thoughts of Theseus fiercely slain, <br>
            And from the lofty rock plunged headlong to the main.</p>
          <p>Thus, when his natal threshold Theseus prest, <br>
            A father's death reproach'd his reckless breast. <br>
            Scarce less his woe, scarce lighter was his care <br>
            Than he had heap'd on the deserted fair ; <br>
            Whose hopeless gaze there linger'd to descry <br>
            His sails just fading into viewless sky, <br>
            While, broken-hearted, in her thoughts she drew <br>
            All shapes of woe and miseries ever new.</p>
          <p>On the rich covering from another part, <br>

            Before his path the Satyrs madly prance, <br>

            Wild sporting round him range the frantic rout, <br>

            Some from the cymbals their thin tinklings clash : <br>
            Some wake the trumpet's hoarser blast and strife, <br>
            Or the sharp note of the discordant fife.</p><pb n="247"/>
            
          <p>Such were the portraitures profusely spread <br>
            O'er the rich covering of the nuptial bed. <br>
            Pall'd with the sight the throng now bending home <br>
            Left for celestial guests the festal dome. <br>
            As when young Zephyr flits across the plain, <br>
            Rippling with early breath the placid main ; <br>
            What time Aurora smiles on day begun <br>
            With all the freshest glory of the sun ; <br>
            Soft break the waves, and low their laughing sound, <br>
            But soon with blasts increasing swell around, <br>
            And loud and louder roar, and far away <br>
            Raging toss back the purple beams of day ; <br>
            So the close crowd, that left the palace, spread, <br>
            And wide dispersing urged their quickening tread.</p>
          <p>Chiron the first, when all the dome was still, <br>
            His rural offering bore from Pelion's hill. <br>
            Whatever flowers the meads produce, whatever <br>
            Thessalia's broad and fertile mountains bear, <br>
            Whatever blossom some poor streamlet near <br>
            The tepid breezes of Favonius rear, <br>
            He brought in chaplets of promiscuous bloom ; <br>
            And all the palace breathed their glad perfume.</p>
          <p>Then Peneus came from Tempe's verdant glades, <br>
            Tempe, encircled by overhanging shades, <br>
            Where Nessos' lovely maids their carols pour. <br>
            Peneus the towering beech uprooted bore, <br>
            The plane, whose leaves in every zephyr play, <br>
            The lofty cypress, and the tapering bay, <br>
            And that tall tree whose form the sisters fair <br>
            Of blasted Phaeton were doom'd to bear. <br>
            These round the dome he placed, a blooming screen, <br>
            And veil'd the porch with interwoven green.</p>
          <p>Next came Prometheus, rich in craftiest lore, <br>
            Who yet faint marks of ancient penance bore ; <br>
            When erst his limbs in flinty bondage stiff <br>
            Were hung extended on the dizzy cliff.</p>
          <p>Then with his sacred queen and all his race <br>
            The sire of gods the palace deign'd to grace; <br>
             <pb n="248"/>
            All, save thee, Phœbus, and thy sister bright, <br>
            The sylvan huntress upon Ida's height; <br>
            Alike ye Peleus both beheld with scorn. <br>
            Nor Thetis' nuptials would as guests adorn. <br>
            Soon as the glorious host were seated round, <br>
            A lavish feast the costly table crown'd ; <br>
            Then through their frames while aged tremors ran, <br>
            The ancient Fates their prescient song began. <br>
            Round their weak bodies a white robe was flung, <br>
            Whose crimson border o'er their ankles hung ; <br>
            Their purple locks with snowy bands were tied; <br>
            And aye their hands the sacred labour plied. <br>
            The left the distaff grasp'd, the right hand drew <br>
            The wool from thence, and twisted in the clew, <br>
            On the bent thumb the winding spindle held, <br>
            And as the whirlwind moves its course impell'd. <br>
            Still as they spun they bit off every shred <br>
            That roughly hung about the new-made thread; <br>
            And the coarse fibres rent in ragged strips <br>
            Clung white and dry upon their shrivell'd lips. <br>
            Rush-baskets held of wool a snowy choice : <br>
            Still as they toil'd they pour'd a piercing voice, <br>
            And hymn'd prophetic destiny's behest, <br>
            Whose truth all future ages shall attest.</p>

          <p>Such was the bliss to Peleus which of old <br>
            In lofty song the prescient Fates foretold. <br>
            For oft, while piety was yet revered <br>
            By pristine man, the gods on earth appear'd; <br>
            And, entering oft some hero's pure abode, <br>
            To human crowds immortal beauty show'd.</p>
          <p>Oft heaven's dread father, when the festal day <br>
            Would to his name its yearly rite display, <br>
            Himself would visit the resplendent fane, <br>
            And see his hundred chariots scour the plain. <br>
            Oft from Parnassus Bacchus drove his flocks <br>
            Of Thyads rev'lling with dishevell'd locks ; <br>
            When all the Delphians from their city pour'd, <br>
            And glad with smoking shrines the god adored. <br>
             <pb n="251"/>
            Oft 'mid the deadly warfare, proudly seen, <br>
            Would horrid Mars, or rapid Triton's queen, <br>
            Or Nemesis, Rhamnusian maid, incite <br>
            Their armed throngs to brave the thickest fight. <br>
            But when this earth with impious crime was stain'd, <br>
            When virtue fled from man, and passion reign'd ; <br>
            When brothers dyed their hands in brothers' gore ; <br>
            When children wept a parent's death no more ; <br>
            When the harsh father sigh'd for early fate <br>
            To snatch the first-born of his buried mate ; <br>
            And leave him free from fonder ties, to press <br>
            Some blooming stepdame in his faint caress ; <br>
            When e'en the mother, warm'd by youthful charms, <br>
            Lured her unconscious offspring to her arms ; <br>
            Bade incest's curse her household gods condemn, <br>
            Impious alike to nature and to them ; <br>
            When rival honour crime and virtue knew ; <br>
            Their favour justly all the gods withdrew ; <br>
            No more to visit sinful earth would deign, <br>
            Nor let the eye of man their forms profane. LAMB.</p>

          <p>No peasant tills the fields ; the steers are eased <br>
            Of the neck-galling yoke ; no bull upturns <br>
            With downward sloping share the mouldering glebe; <br>
            Discolouring rust soils the deserted plough, <br>

            The crumbling earth; nor he that prunes the bough <br>
            Lops with his lightening hook the leafy tree. <br>
            The palace, through its inner space discern'd <br>
            Of long receding halls, shone gorgeously <br>
            With gold and burnish'd silver; couches gleam'd <br>

            In the mid chamber for the goddess bride, <br>
            Rose high with plumy cushions. It was carved <br>
            From teeth of Indic elephants, and spread <br>
            With the shell purple's crimson of the se?</p><pb n="252"/>
            
          <p>l'he tapestried covering, wrought with antique forms <br>
            Of men, display'd heroic lore, in threads <br>
            Of wondrous art. For there upon the shore <br>
            Long echoing to the flowing sound of waves <br>
            Stood Ariadne, casting a far look <br>
            On Theseus as in rapid bark he passed <br>
            Away ; and pangs of furious wild despair <br>
            Master'd her throbbing heart. Nor yet believed <br>
            That she was Ariadne ; while scarce waked <br>
            From her deceiving sleep, she saw herself <br>
            Left wretched on the solitary sands. <br>
            The youth, who could forget her, flying beat <br>
            The billows with his oars, and left his vows <br>
            Light scatter'd to the winds and to the storms. <br>
            Him when the princess from the weedy shore <br>
            Discerned remote, she bent her straining eyes, <br>
            In posture like the statue of a nymph <br>
            Nodding in Bacchic orgies ; troubled thoughts <br>
            Rush'd on her soul, like waves; nor suffer'd she <br>
            The slender mitre on her yellow hair ; <br>
            Or the transparent scarf that o'er her breast <br>
            Spread light its covering ; or the girdle's grasp <br>
            'Gainst which her bosom's struggling orbs rebell'd ; <br>
            But all torn wildly off from all her form <br>
            Lay strewn on every side, and the salt seas, <br>
            White foaming at her feet, broke over them. <br>
            She nor her mitre, nor her floating zone <br>
            Regarded aught : on thee, 0 Theseus !-still <br>
            On thee she dwelt with heart and mind and soul <br>
            Distracted. Ah ! unhappy one ! how grief <br>
            And senseless frenzy seized her ! and what thorns <br>
            Of anguish Venus planted in her breast ! <br>
            In that heroic age did Theseus leave <br>
            Piræus' winding bay, and visited <br>
            The Cretan walls of that inhuman king. <br>
            For legends tell that Athens, erst constrain'd <br>
            By cruel pestilence, atoned the death <br>
            Of slain Androgeos ; and a tribute sent <br>
            Of chosen youths, and maids in beauty's flower, <br>
            To glut the monstrous Minotaur. When thus <br>
            The noble city underneath its curse <br>
             <pb n="253"/>
            Groan'd heavily, the gallant Theseus chose <br>
            To perish self-devoted, in behalf <br>
            Of his dear Athens, rather than these maids <br>
            Find graves in Crete, yet need a funeral rite. <br>
            So, in light bark, with gentle breeze he sail'd <br>
            To awful Minos, and his stately court. <br>
            When on the stranger fell the eager gaze <br>
            Of that same royal virgin, who reposed <br>
            Within her mother's arms, on pillow chaste <br>
            That breathed sweet perfumes, like the myrtle buds <br>
            On green Eurotas' river-banks, or breath <br>
            Of the spring gale, that draws the colours forth <br>
            From all the streaky flowers. No sooner then <br>
            The gazing maid withdrew her glowing eyes, <br>
            And bent them on the floor, than all her breast <br>
            Conceived a flame, and all her vitals burn'd.</p>
          <p>Oil sacred boy ! that, merciless of heart, <br>
            Troubles!, alas, how cruelly ! the soul <br>
            With passion's fury, yet with human griefs <br>
            Minglest delights ; and thou, 0 Venus ! queen <br>
            Of Golgos and Idalia's leafy lawns ; <br>
            With what a sea of troubles did ye toss <br>
            The maiden's heart; with what a flame consume ! <br>
            When for the stranger of the yellow locks <br>
            She drew full many a sigh. How langnish'd she <br>
            In heart-struck terrors ! how her cheek grew pale <br>
            With yellowing tinge, like the wan shine of gold, <br>
            When Theseus, match'd against the monster, sought <br>
            Death or the palm of glory ! Nor to heaven <br>
            Vow'd she unpleasing offerings, though to her <br>
            Fruitless ; nor vainly on her silent lips <br>
            Whisper'd suspended hopes. For as the blast <br>
            Of irresistible whirlwind with a rush <br>
            Of sudden eddy shakes a branching oak <br>
            On the Mount Taurus ; or cone-rustling pine, <br>
            Dropping with gum ; and smites the knotted trunk; <br>
            Wrench'd from the roots, the tree falls headlong down, <br>
            And crushes all beneath it: with such force <br>
            Did Theseus quell the savage prostrated <br>
            In dust, and beating with his horns the wind.</p><pb n="254"/>
            
          <p>Then, in his glory, he secure retraced <br>
            His footsteps, governing with silken skein <br>
            His wandering feet; lest measuring forth his way <br>
            From winding of the labyrinth, he should err, <br>
            Foil'd by the cunning edifice, that spread <br>
            Its undiscoverable maze around. <br>
            But why, thus starting from my theme, recount <br>
            Superfluous tales ? how Ariadne left <br>
            Her father's aspect, and her sister's kiss, <br>
            And mother's folding arms ; who, wretched made, <br>
            Should with flush'd weeping mourn her daughter lost ? <br>
            But Theseus' love was dearer than them all. <br>
            Or how the ship was wafted to the shore <br>
            Of Naxos' foaming isle ; or how, when closed <br>
            Her heavy eyes in that disastrous sleep, <br>
            Ingrate lie fled, and left her.—Oft, they say, <br>
            With burning indignation she pour'd forth <br>
            Shrill outcries from the bottom of her heart; <br>
            Climb'd sad the steepy mountains, and threw out <br>
            A long glance o'er the vast and foamy deep ; <br>
            Or on the flat shore ran amidst the waves, <br>
            That swell'd their rippling surface opposite, <br>
            From her bared leg lifting the drapery light ; <br>
            Then, in extremity of anguish, spoke <br>
            These wild upbraidings, with her cheek all bathed <br>
            In tears, while shivering sobs confused her words:</p>
          <p>"And is it thus, perfidious man ! led far <br>
            From my own country, thou forsak'st me now, <br>
            Perfidious Theseus ! on a desert shore ? <br>
            And dost thou then depart, of watchful gods <br>
            Heedless, and ah ! bear with thee to thy home <br>
            Those vows, accurs'd by me ? Could nothing turn <br>
            Thy cruel purpose ? did no sudden thought <br>
            Of pity cross thee ? did thy hard heart feel <br>
            No soft, compunctious visitings for me ? <br>
            Not such thy utter'd promises ; not these <br>
            The hopes thy lips convey'd to me undone ; <br>
            But wedding joys and wishes all fulfill'd <br>
            Of marriage love : now to the winds of air <br>
            Blown and dispersed ! Let never woman trust <br>
             <pb n="255"/>
            The oath of man ; let never woman hope <br>
            Faith in his tender speeches ! He, while aught <br>
            Inflames his ardour to possess, will fear <br>
            No oath, will spare no promise. But when once <br>
            His gust is sated, fears not what he spoke ; <br>
            Heeds not his perjured promise. Yet 'twas I <br>
            That from death's whirlpool snatch'd thee, and resolved <br>
            To sacrifice my brother Minotaur, <br>
            That I might spend with thee life's latest hour, <br>
            Deceiver as thou art !-and 'tis for this <br>
            That forest beasts must tear me ; birds of prey <br>
            Dismember ; and no heap of friendly earth <br>
            Be scattered o'er my corpse !- What lioness <br>
            In wilderness of rocks first brought thee forth ? <br>
            What sea conceived thee in its roaring depths, <br>
            And from its foaming billows cast thee out ? <br>
            Syrt, Scylla, or Charybdis, which, or what <br>
            Art thou, that for the sweets of life bestow'd <br>
            Mak'st this return ? But if thy heart repell'd <br>
            Union with me ; and if to thee seem stern <br>
            The laws of marriage which old Cecrops framed ; <br>
            Thou couldst at least have brought me to thy home, <br>
            That I with pleasant labour might have been <br>
            Thy handmaid ; tenderly thy snowy feet <br>
            Laving in limpid waters, or thy couch <br>
            Spreading with purple coverings. Ah ! what boots <br>
            This frenzy of misfortune ? Why complain <br>
            To the unconscious air, that neither hears <br>
            My utter'd speech, nor can in words reply ? <br>
            He now has nearly pass'd the middle seas ; <br>
            And not one solitary mortal meets <br>
            My gaze along the ocean's weedy shore ; <br>
            And Fate, insulting even my dying hour, <br>
            Envious denies the blessing of complaint <br>
            To listening ears. Oh, mighty Jupiter ! <br>
            Would that in time long past no ships had touch'd <br>
            From Athens on our coast ; no mariner <br>
            With dreadful tribute to the bull had loosed <br>
            His cable, and, perfidious, sail'd for Crete ! <br>
            Nor e'er that stranger, masking in sweet form <br>
            His cruel purpose, rested in my home 1 <br>
             <pb n="256"/>
            Whither shall I betake me ? on what hope <br>
            Lean for support? Say, shall I seek again <br>
            The hills of Cretan Ide ? ah me ! the deep <br>
            Rolls broad its severing flood, and cruel forms <br>
            Of the wide seas a gulf impassable. <br>
            Or might I hope my father's succouring hand? <br>
            I, who could leave him, following this stern youth <br>
            While reeking with my brother's sprinkled blood ? <br>
            Shall I console my sorrows with the love <br>
            Of that so faithful spouse, while now his oars <br>
            Bend pliant in the billows, as he flies ? <br>
            Shall I pass inland, and forsake the shore ? <br>
            No dwelling has this lone, unpeopled isle : <br>
            There is no egress hence ; the sea-waves roll <br>
            A girdle round ; no plan, no hope of flight; <br>
            All solitary, silent, desolate ; <br>
            A prospect of inevitable death. <br>
            But let not yet my dying eyes grow dim, <br>
            Nor sense my faint limbs leave, ere, thus betray'd, <br>
            I ask the gods for vengeance, and attest <br>
            With my last breath the holy faith of heaven. <br>
            Ye, then, that with retributive revenge <br>
            Visit the deeds of men ; whose forehead 'twined <br>
            With snaky hair, waves with th' avenging wrath <br>
            Of my expiring breast, arise and hear ! <br>
            Come to my side : come listen the complaints, <br>
            Which, oh me miserable ! I perforce <br>
            Now from my inmost vitals breathe, thus lost, <br>
            Burning, and blind with my delirious rage, <br>
            Since from the very bottom of my heart <br>
            I heave this plaintive voice, oh suffer not <br>
            My tears and groans to vanish on the winds ! <br>
            But in the spirit that within him wrought, <br>
            When he forsook me on the desert shore, <br>
            In that same spirit, deadly to himself <br>
            And to his kindred, let him stain his house <br>
            With horror and pollution." <br>
            When she thus <br>
            Had given her sorrows utterance, and had call'd <br>
            In her distraction heavenly vengeance down <br>

            His head, and at his unresisted nod <br>
            Earth and sea trembled, and the firmament <br>
            Rock'd its bright orbs. But Theseus, dark of mind, <br>
            Dismiss'd from memory all injunctions past, <br>
            Though long with heed retain'd : nor lifted up <br>
            The gladdening symbol, that he safe return'd <br>
            To his own country's harbours, in the eyes <br>
            Of his long sorrowing father. Story tells <br>
            That when old Ægeus trusted to the winds <br>
            His son, who bent his galley's sails to leave <br>
            Minerva's towers, he clasp'd him in his arms, <br>
            And gave this mandate :­ <br>
            " Oh, my only son ! <br>
            More pleasant in mine eyes than length of life <br>
            My son ! whom I, perforce, dismiss to cope <br>
            With doubtful perils ; son ! so lately lent <br>
            Again to these fond arms, in the last stage <br>
            Of feeble years: since now my mournful hap <br>
            And thy own fervid valour tear thee hence <br>
            From these unwilling eyes, whose languid orbs <br>
            Still gaze unsated on my son's dear face; <br>
            Not glad I send thee hence; nor shalt thou beai <br>
            Symbols of prosperous Fortune. I will ease <br>
            My bosom of complaint, and soil in dust <br>
            My hoary locks; and on thy flitting mast <br>
            Suspend discolour'd sails; that this my grief <br>
            And soul-inflaming anguish may be read <br>
            In thy Iberian canvass, while its folds <br>
            Are tinged with dusky blue. If she, who dwelt <br>
            In blest Itonus, Pallas, who defends <br>
            Our race and city, grant that in the blood <br>
            Of that half human bull thy hand be red ; <br>
            Then bury these injunctions in thy heart; <br>
            Let them take growth, and flourish, so that time <br>
            May never root them out. Soon as thine eyes <br>
            Behold our hills again, then let thy crew <br>
            The dismal canvass on the yard-arm furl, <br>
            And hoist with ropes the sails of snowy white: <br>
            That, seeing, I may recognise the joy <br>
            Of that blest moment, when auspicious time <br>
            Returns thee present to mine eyes again." <note type="footnote"> S </note> <pb n="258"/>
            </p>
          <p>These mandates, which before with constant mind <br>
            He cherish'd, now from Theseus' memory fled, <br>
            Like mists from airy ridge of snowy Alp <br>
            Swept by the whirlwind. Still the father bent <br>
            From a high turret's top his straining eyes, <br>
            Anxious, and dim with weeping. When he saw <br>
            The sable swelling sails, from the steep rocks <br>
            He cast himself down headlong ; deeming then <br>
            His Theseus lost by an inhuman death. <br>
            So Theseus, glorying in the monster slain, <br>
            Enter'd beneath his father's roof, now changed <br>
            With funeral horror; and himself now felt <br>
            A portion of that anguish, which, ingrate <br>
            Of soul, he fix'd in Ariadne's breast: <br>
            When, wounded to the heart, a thousand griefs <br>
            Roll'd in her bosom, while she pensive bent <br>
            On the receding ship her lengthening gaze.</p>
          <p>But in another part, Iacchus, flush'd <br>
            With bloom of youth, came flying from above, <br>
            With choirs of Satyrs, and Silent, born <br>
            In Indian Nyse : seeking thee he came, <br>
            O Ariadne ! with thy love inflamed. <br>
            They, blithe, from every side came revelling on, <br>
            Distraught with jocund madness: with a burst <br>
            Of Bacchic outcries, and with tossing heads. <br>
            Some shook their ivy-shrouded spears ; and some <br>
            From hand to hand, in wild and fitful feast, <br>
            Snatch'd a torn heifer's limbs: some girt themselves <br>
            With twisted serpents : others bore along, <br>
            In hollow arks, the mysteries of the god: <br>
            Mysteries to uninitiated ear <br>
            In silence wrapt. On timbrels others smote <br>
            With tapering hands, or from smooth orbs of brass <br>
            Clank'd shrill a tinkling sound; and many blew <br>
            The horn's hoarse blare, and the barbaric pipe <br>
            Bray'd harsh upon the ear its dinning tune.</p>
          <p>Thus gorgeously with colour'd figures wrought <br>

          <p>When now the throng of Thessaly had gazed <br>
            Their eager fill, they reverently gave place <br>
            To step of gods approaching. As the gale, <br>
            Ruffling the calm sea with its murmuring breeze. <br>
            Stirs the sloped waves, at rising of the dawn, <br>
            Beneath the flitting lustre of the sun: <br>
            They, forward driven with gentle blast, roll on <br>
            Slowly, and as with sounds of laughter shrill <br>
            Dash their soft echo; till the growing wind <br>
            Freshens, and more and more in heaving swell <br>
            They float far glittering in the purple light: <br>
            So from the palace vestibule the throng <br>
            Flow'd gradual forth, and wandered wide away. ELTON.</p>

            How stars at certain times are seen no more; <br>

            Which she, with arms outstretch'd in suppliant love, <br>
            Vow'd to devote to many gods above ; <br>
            What time the king, scarce past the nuptial rite, <br>
            Warm from th' unequal contest of the night, <br>
            Flush'd with its spoil and proud of amorous wounds, <br>

          <p>Do brides, 0 Venus ! hate the bridal bed, <br>
            Or feign the tears they oft profusely shed, <br>
            The tears that parents gladly mark arise <br>

            But, queen, thy sorrows did not mourn alone <br>

            Thy temple's shade and forehead's wavy grace, <br>
            That heaven might speed thy lord's returning hour, <br>
            And Asia's nation bow to Egypt's power ? <br>
            He conquer'd and return'd.—The vow was paid, <br>

            Such, where Canopus crowns the fertile wave, <br>
            The mandate Flora to her Zephyr gave.</p>
          <p>" Permit no more," she cried, " the crown, that shed <br>
            Its radiance erst round Ariadne's head, <br>
            Alone in heaven to lift its lovely flame, <br>
            Nor any star possess congenial fame : <br>
            Bid the rich spoil of Berenice's brow <br>
            Dart rival beams and share that glory now."</p>
          <p>To heaven the goddess raised me, bathed in tears, <br>
            An added splendour to the starry spheres. <br>
            Betwixt the Lion and the Virgin chaste, <br>
            Close to Lycaon's child Callisto placed, <br>
            Turn'd from the east, I slow Boötes guide <br>
            In tardy progress to the western tide. <br>
            I stud that way, in that bright path I lie, <br>
            Oft pass'd by gods when journeying o'er the sky : <br>
            When night is still, and dark the solar blaze, <br>
            They tread my light, and trample on my rays ; <br>
            But dawn returning bids me Tethys greet, <br>
            And hide my splendour in her cool retreat.</p>
          <p>But still—and let me. Nemesis, reveal <br>
            In peace the truth no terror shall conceal ; <br>
            Let every star reproachful curses dart, <br>
            I will unfold the secret of my heart ! <br>
            Though high 'mid heaven's immortal splendour placed, <br>
            I still regret the fair whom erst I graced. <br>
            Upon her polish'd brows, while yet a maid, <br>
            Unbraided, unperfumed, my ringlets stray'd ; <br>
            And drank the breath in wedlock's costlier hours <br>
            Of rarest unguents and the balmiest flowers.</p>
          <p>And, 0 ye fair ! allured by Hymen's light, <br>
            Ere yet the husband gains his dearest right, <br>
            Ere your smooth bosoms heave from cincture free. <br>
            Let sweets in rich libation flow to me.</p><pb n="263"/>
            
          <p>Dear is the incense on my altar spread <br>
            By all who seek the chaste, the nuptial bed ; <br>
            But the foul offering of disgraceful lust <br>
            Shall sink forgotten in the barren dust: <br>
            Adulterers' gifts with loathing I reject, <br>
            Nor prize their worship, nor their love protect. <br>
            But bliss and passion ever young reside <br>
            With the fond bridegroom and the faithful bride.</p>
          <p>But, queen, when thou shalt gaze upon the skies, <br>
            And bid thine orisons to Venus rise, <br>
            Though blood must never stain the Paphian shrine ; <br>
            Hope not by prayers alone to make me thine : <br>
            With purest offerings urge thy costly vows, <br>
            And speed my wish'd return to deck thy brows. <br>
            There will I wave, nor heed what ills betide, <br>
            Though dark Orion seek Aquarius' side, <br>
            And constant storms and elemental wars <br>
            Proclaim the wild disorder of the stars. LAMB.</p>

          <p>THE sage who view'd the shining heav'ns on high, <br>
            Explored the glories of th' expanded sky; <br>
            Whence rise the radiant orbs, where still they bend <br>
            Their wand'ring course, and where at length descend; <br>
            Why dim eclipse obscures the blazing sun; <br>
            Why stars at certain times to darkness run ; <br>
            How Trivia nightly stole from realms above <br>
            To taste on Latmos' rocks the sweets of love. <br>
            Immortal Conon, blest with skill divine, <br>
            Amid the sacred skies beheld me shine, <br>
            Ev'n me, the beauteous hair, that lately shed <br>
            Refulgent beams from Berenice's head ; <br>
            The lock she fondly vow'd with lifted arms, <br>
            Imploring all the powers to save from harms <br>
            Her dearer lord, when from his bride he flew, <br>
            To wreak stern vengeance on th' Assyrian crew ; <br>
            While yet the monarch bore the pleasing scars <br>
            Of softer triumphs and nocturnal wars.</p>
          <p>O sacred queen, do virgins still despise <br>
            The joys of Venus and the nuptial ties, <br>
             <pb n="264"/>
            When oft in bridal rooms their sighs and tears <br>
            Distract the parent's heart with anxious fears ? <br>
            The tears descend from friendly powers above; <br>
            The sighs, ye gods ! are only sighs of love. <br>
            With tears like these fair Berenice mourn'd <br>
            When for her virgin spoils the monarch burn'd ; <br>
            With sighs like these she gave him all her charms, <br>
            And bless'd the raptured bridegroom in her arms.</p>
          <p>But on the widow'd bed you wept alone, <br>
            And mourn'd the brother in the husband gone. <br>
            What sorrow then my pensive queen opprest, <br>
            What pangs of absence tore her tender breast; <br>
            When, lost in woe, no trace remained behind <br>
            Of all her virgin mirth and strength of mind. <br>
            Hadst thou forgot the deed thy worth achieved, <br>
            For which thy brows the imperial crown received ; <br>
            The wondrous deed that placed thee far beyond <br>
            Thy fair compeers and made a monarch fond ?</p>
          <p>But when for wars he left your tender arms, <br>
            What words you spoke, with what endearing charms, <br>
            Still breathed your soft complaints in mournful sighs, <br>
            And wiped with lifted hands your streaming eyes. <br>
            Didst thou, fair nymph, lament by power divine, <br>
            Or for an absent lover only pine ? <br>
            Then to the gods you vow'd with pious care <br>
            A sacred offering, your immortal hair, <br>
            With blood of slaughtered bulls, would heaven restore <br>
            Your lord in triumph to his native shore ; <br>
            Should lie, returning soon, with high renown <br>
            Add vanquished Asia to the Egyptian crown : <br>
            And I, fair lock, from orbs of radiance now <br>
            Diffuse new light to pay thy former vow. <br>
            But hear, 0 queen, the sacred oath I swear, <br>
            By thy bright head, and yet remaining hair, <br>
            I join'd unwilling the ethereal sphere; <br>
            And well I know what woes the perjured feel: <br>
            But none can conquer unresisted steel. <br>
            Steel heaved the mightiest mountain to the ground <br>
            That Sol beholds in his diurnal round, <br>
             <pb n="265"/>
            Through Athos' rocky sides a passage tore, <br>
            When first the Medes arrived at Phthia's shore. <br>
            Then winds and waves drove their swift ships along. <br>
            And through the new-made gulf impell'd the throng. <br>
            If these withstood not steel's all-conquering blow, <br>
            What could thy hairs against so dire a foe ? <br>
            O mighty Jove ! may still thy wrath divine <br>
            Pour fierce destruction on their impious line, <br>
            Who dug with hands accurst the hollow mine ; <br>
            Who first from earth could shining ore produce, <br>
            First temper'd steel, and taught its various use.</p>
          <p>As thy bright locks bewail'd their sister gone, <br>
            Arsinoe's horseman, Memnon's only son, <br>
            On flutt'ring wings descended from on high, <br>
            To bear the beauteous hairs above the sky ; <br>
            Then upward bent his flight, and softly placed <br>
            Thy radiant lock in chaste Arsinoe's breast, <br>
            Whom we Zephyritis and Venus name, <br>
            And on Canopus' shores her altars flame ; <br>
            When late the winged messenger came down <br>
            At her desire, lest Ariadne's crown <br>
            Should still unrivall'd glitter in the skies ; <br>
            And that thy precious hair, a richer prize, <br>
            The spoils devoted to the powers divine, <br>
            Might from the fields of light as brightly shine. <br>
            Yet bathed in tears I wing'd my rapid flight, <br>
            Swift from her shrine to this ethereal height, <br>
            And, placed amidst the fair celestial signs, <br>
            Thy lock for ever with new glory shines, <br>
            Just by the Virgin in the starry sphere, <br>
            The savage Lion, and the Northern Bear. <br>
            Full to the west with sparkling beams I lead, <br>
            And bright Boötes in my course precede, <br>
            Who scarcely moves along the ethereal plain, <br>
            And late and slowly sinks beneath the main.</p>
          <p>Though feet of gods surround my throne by night; <br>
            And in the seas I sleep with morning light, <br>
            Yet, 0 Rhamnusian maid, propitious hear <br>
            The words of sacred truth unawed by fear.</p><pb n="266"/>
            
          <p>The words of truth I wish not to conceal, <br>
            But still the dictates of my breast reveal. <br>
            Though these resplendent orbs in wrath should rise <br>
            And hurl me headlong from the flaming skies, <br>
            Though placed on high, sad absence I deplore, <br>
            Condemned to join my lovely queen no more, <br>
            On whose fair head, while yet in virgin bloom, <br>
            I drank unmeasured sweets and rich perfume.</p>
          <p>But now, ye maids, and every beauteous dame, <br>
            For whom on nuptial nights the torches flame, <br>
            Though fondly wedded to some lovely boy, <br>
            Your virgin choice, and partner of your joy, <br>
            Forbear to taste the pleasures of a bride, <br>
            Nor from your bosoms draw the veil aside, <br>
            Till oils in alabaster ye prepare, <br>
            And chastely pour on Berenice's hair. <br>
            But I th' impure adulteress will confound, <br>
            And dash the ungrateful offering on the ground. <br>
            From her no rich libation I demand ; <br>
            I scorn the gift of her unhallow'd hand : <br>
            But if the virtuous fair invoke my power, <br>
            Unbounded bliss shall crown the nuptial hour ; <br>
            To her shall concord from high heaven descend, <br>
            And constant love her soft retreats attend.</p>
          <p>And when, bright queen, on solemn feasts your eyef <br>
            Shall hail Arsinoe radiant in the skies ; <br>
            When she demands, bright opening on your view, <br>
            The sacred rites to heavenly Venus due ; <br>
            If thy loved lock appear resplendent there, <br>
            Let me with her an equal offering share. <br>
            But why should these surrounding stars detain <br>
            Thy golden hairs in this ethereal plain ? <br>
            Oh could I join thy beauteous head once more, <br>
            The sacred head on which I grew before ; <br>
            Though I should ever lose my light divine, <br>
            And moist Arcturus next the Virgin shine. TITLES</p><pb n="267"/>

            Can soothe my mind where anguish never rests ; <br>
            That hapless letter still my bosom cheers, <br>
            Those lines are dear, though written with thy tears: <br>
            For, ah ! they speak thy love, and bid me send <br>
            Verse from the bard, affection from the friend. <br>
            Think not I wish my duty to disown <br>
            To the first friend my life has ever known ; <br>
            But, Manlius, learn my own unhappy state; <br>
            Learn in how rough a sea of troublous fate <br>

            His early fate has from my bosom chased <br>
            All former joys, and all the mind can taste. <br>
            Then cry not, " Shame, Catullus should be known <br>

            No, Manlius, call it not disgrace or shame, <br>
            For keenest misery is the fitter name. <br>
            Forgive me then, if thou shalt ask in vain <br>
            The gifts that sorrow from myself has ta'en. <br>
            No hoard of writers here their fires infuse, <br>
            To guide my taste and cheer my drooping Muse: <br>
            Few favourite volumes serve to fill the void, <br>
            And chase the gloom of leisure unemploy'd. <br>
            Rome holds my home, my comfort, and my care. <br>
            And life is only life when I am there.</p><pb n="270"/>
            
          <p>Then think not fretful envy prompts my part. <br>
            Or gratitude is irksome to my heart ; <br>
            Forced to refuse to each request of thine <br>
            Gifts I had sent unask'd, bad they been mine. <br>
            Yet can I not, ye Nine, the tale repress, <br>
            How Manlius still has toil'd my life to bless ; <br>
            Nor let oblivious time its gloom extend <br>
            O'er the dear memory of so true a friend. <br>
            To you I speak his praise, do ye unfold <br>
            To countless crowds the praises I have told. <br>
            Let this time-honour'd verse for ever tell <br>
            To future days the name I loved so well; <br>
            And when at length, alas ! his aged head <br>
            Shall rest inurn'd among the noble dead, <br>
            Wider and wider still his praise proclaim, <br>
            When all of him that lives will be his fame. <br>
            Thus, by its theme immortal, shall my page <br>
            Live still perused in every distant age ; <br>
            Nor spider ever venture to profane <br>
            With lazy web my laudatory strain.</p>
          <p>Ye know how Venus false my life oppress'd, <br>
            With what destroying flame she scorch'd my breast, <br>
            Hot as the fires that Etna's crater fill, <br>
            Or Malia's springs that boil near Eta's hill. <br>
            With wasting tears my eyes were dim and weak, <br>
            And sorrow's drops for ever bathed my cheek. <br>
            As, springing on some mountain's airy throne, <br>
            The crystal streamlet from the mossy stone <br>
            Through the slope valley hurrying headlong down, <br>
            Crosses the busy road to some rich town ; <br>
            A blest refreshment to the trav'ller's toil, <br>
            When arid heat has crack'd the fever'd soil. <br>
            As, when through storms the sailor long has pray'd <br>
            To Pollux now, and now for Castor's aid, <br>
            Soft breathes the favouring air and calms the sea ; <br>
            Such Manlius was, such help and bliss to me. <br>
            When narrow bounds confined my poor domain, <br>
            He made me master of a spacious plain ; <br>
            He bounteous placed me in a rich abode, <br>
            And the fond girl. whose love we shared, bestow'd. <br>
             <pb n="271"/>
            That home my goddess blest: that mansion bore <br>
            Her graceful foot upon its tell-tale floor; <br>
            There oft her creaking sandal, sweet to hear, <br>
            Foretold the fair one to her lover's ear.</p>
          <p>Thus erst, while love warned every blissful thought, <br>
            Her husband's home Laodamia sought. <br>
            Too eager bride ! No victim led to die <br>
            Had yet propitiated the gods on high. <br>
            (Thy power, dread Nemesis, hath still suppress'd <br>
            All hopes unsanction'd by the heavens' behest: <br>
            Hapless, who grasp, unless the gods approve, <br>
            The proffer'd gift of glory, wealth, or love !) <br>
            Soon did she learn how keen the thirsty fine <br>
            Desires the sacred blood of victims slain, <br>
            Forced from her parting husband's neck to tear <br>
            The close embrace that long'd to linger there; <br>
            Ere yet two winters in their length of nights <br>
            Had glutted passion with its own delights ; <br>
            Or taught the bride, a strength how hard to give ! <br>
            To lose the mate she loved, and yet to live. <br>
            The Fates well knew this doom not distant far <br>
            If the bold chieftain sought the Trojan war. <br>
            For then had Troy by stealth of Helen's charms <br>
            Roused 'gainst herself the kings of Greece to arms. <br>
            Troy, baleful, impious Troy ! the common grave <br>
            Of Europe's warriors and of Asia's brave ! <br>
            Troy, whose vast ruin the sad ashes boasts <br>
            Of wisdom, valour, and unnumber'd hosts ! <br>
            Troy, where my brother died, untimely torn <br>
            From the lone wretch whom he has left to mourn ! <br>
            Alas ! his eyes are closed in lasting gloom ! <br>
            Brother, our house lies with thee in the tomb ; <br>
            Thy friendship still my life with pleasures fed, <br>
            And all my pleasures now with thee are dead. <br>
            Not 'mid ancestral tombs for ages traced, <br>
            Nor with the urns of kindred ashes placed ; <br>
            But hateful Troy, Troy's melancholy plains <br>
            Hold in ungenial soil thy loved remains. <br>
            To Troy then hastening, the assembled band <br>
            Of Grecian youth had left their native land, <br>
             <pb n="272"/>
            To burst on Paris with the din of arms, <br>
            To rouse him from th' adulteress matron’s charms ; <br>
            Nor let his wrong its lawless rapture shed <br>
            On days of quiet or a peaceful bed.</p>
          <p>'Twas in that hour, that he, beloved too well, <br>
            Thine heart-dear spouse, Laodamia, fell; <br>
            And wild despair with overwhelming flow <br>
            Hurried thee down the deep abyss of woe. <br>
            Less deep that gulf described in Grecian lands, <br>
            Where Pheneus flows and high Cyllene stands, <br>
            Which pour'd the waste of waters through its drain, <br>
            And gave to man the firm and fertile plain. <br>
            Amphytrion's falsely-father'd son, they say, <br>
            Through the broad mountain clove its lofty way, <br>
            When, by a worthless lord's command employ'd, <br>
            His darts the birds of Stymphalus destroy'd: <br>
            'Twas for a throne in heaven his task he plied, <br>
            And blooming Hebe for his virgin bride.</p>
          <p>How vast, how deep that gulf upon whose soil <br>
            A slaving god had spent a lengthen’d toil ! <br>
            More vast the love that warm'd thy bridal vows ; <br>
            More deep thy sorrow for thy plighted spouse. <br>
            Not to the sire so dear, when grey with years, <br>
            The late-born son an only daughter rears ; <br>
            Who, soon as first he draws the vital air, <br>
            Named by his grandsire for his only heir, <br>
            Blasts the fond hopes that hungry kinsmen fed ; <br>
            And drives like vultures from the hoary head. <br>
            Not e'en so much the tender sports of love <br>
            Please the soft partner of the snowy dove, <br>
            Who still with fire, to which her mate's is weak, <br>
            Plucks ceaseless kisses with a clinging beak. <br>
            (Never can love to manly breasts impart <br>
            The doting ardour of the female heart.) <br>
            With all their fires thy glowing passion vied, <br>
            When first the fair-hair'd warrior claim'd his bride.</p>
          <p>Thus erst, thy bright compeer in love and charms, <br>
            Light of my life, the damsel sought my arms ; <br>
             <pb n="273"/>
            While Cupid, then in saffron vest array'd, <br>
            Hovering on sportive wing around her play'd. <br>
            What though, too warm to freeze in rigid truth, <br>
            Her love at times may bless some other youth ; <br>
            Well may her favourite uncomplaining bear <br>
            The stolen falsehoods of the modest fair. <br>
            Vex not your amorous lives with jealous pain, <br>
            Juno, (if such compare be not profane,) <br>
            Imperial Juno knew the lusts of Jove, <br>
            Still daily false, yet view'd him still with love. <br>
            Love, independent love, no care requires, <br>
            No chilling sanction of intrusive sires ; <br>
            For by no father's formal conduct brought, <br>
            No Syrian odours fill'd the home she sought: <br>
            But on that wondrous night, all nights above ! <br>
            She gave at once the fullest gift of love ; <br>
            In that same night <unclear>hastow’d</unclear>, in that possessed, <br>
            Warm from her la<unclear/> ill bed and husband's breast. <br>
            Enough that I that night of rapture pass'd, <br>
            Enough, had e'en that rapture been my last!</p>
          <p>This gift of verse, 'tis all I can, I send <br>

            Blest be the lass, who, still of either fond, <br>

          <p>WHILE playfully sporting, I ventured to snatch <br>
            A kiss from thy lips, dearest maid of my soul; <br>
            And all heaven's ambrosia itself could not match <br>
            The ravishing sweetness of that which I stole.</p>
          <p>Ah ! 'twas not unpunish’d.—I suffer'd more pain <br>
            Than the crucified wretch left to linger awhile. <br>
            For pardon I sued ; but not tears could obtain <br>
            One accent of kindness, one favouring smile.</p>
          <p>You scornfully cleansed from the lip I'd possess'd <br>
            Every trace, every feeling by mine left behind ; <br>
            And wash'd it, as if by some profligate prest, <br>
            The foulest in person and basest in mind:</p>
          <p>You sought every method to banish my bliss, <br>
            And Love the tormentor's rough duty embraced ; <br>
            Till all its ambrosia was lost to the kiss, <br>
            And 'twas bitter as bitterest hellebore's taste.</p>
          <p>If this penance must follow each amorous slip, <br>
            From such thefts I for ever an abstinence vow ; <br>
            For not even the sweetness I taste on your lip <br>

            And those who always loved, now love the more</p>
          <p>She paints the purple year with varied show, <br>
            Tips the green gem, and makes the blossom glow. <br>
            She makes the turgid buds receive the breeze, <br>
            Expand io leaves and shade the naked trees. <br>
            When gathering damps the misty nights diffuse, <br>
            She sprinkles all the morn with balmy dews ; <br>
             <pb n="294"/>
            Bright trembling pearls depend at every spray, <br>
            And kept from falling, seem to fall away. <br>
            A glossy freshness hence the rose receives, <br>
            And blushes sweet through all her silken leaves ; <br>
            (The drops descending through the silent night, <br>
            While stars serenely roll their golden light <br>
            Close till the morn her humid veil she holds ; <br>
            Then decked with virgin pomp the flower unfolds. <br>
            Soon will the morning blush, ye maids, prepare: <br>
            In rosy garlands bind your flowing hair; <br>
            'Tis Venus' plant: the blood fair Venus shed, <br>
            O'er the gay beauty pour'd immortal red : <br>
            From love's soft kiss a sweet ambrosial smell <br>
            Was taught for ever on the leaves to dwell; <br>
            From gems, from flames, from orient rays of light, <br>
            The richest lustre makes her purple bright ; <br>
            And she to-morrow weds ; the sportive gale <br>
            Unties her zone; she bursts the verdant veil ; <br>
            Through all her sweets the rifling lover flies, <br>
            And as he breathes, her glowing fires arise.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before; <br>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>Now fair Dione to the myrtle grove <br>
            Sends the gay Nymphs, and sends her tender love. <br>
            And shall they venture ? Is it safe to go, <br>
            While nymphs have hearts and Cupid wears a bow ? <br>
            Yes, safely venture ;'tis his mother's will ; <br>
            He walks unarm'd and undesiring ill; <br>
            His torch extinct, his quiver useless hung, <br>
            His arrows idle, and his bow unstrung. <br>
            And yet, ye nymphs, beware, his eyes have charms : <br>
            And love that's naked, still is love in arms.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <br>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>From Venus' bower to Delia's lodge repairs <br>
            A virgin train complete with modest airs : <br>
            " Chaste Delia, grant our suit! oh shun the wood; <br>
            Nor stain this sacred lawn with savage blood.</p><pb n="295"/>
            
          <p>Venus, 0 Delia, if she could persuade, <br>
            Would ask thy presence, might she ask a maid." <br>
            Here cheerful choirs for three auspicious nights <br>
            With songs prolong the pleasurable rites : <br>
            Her crowds in measures lightly decent move ; <br>
            Or seek by pairs the covert of the grove, <br>
            Where meeting greens for arbours arch above, <br>
            And mingling flowerets strew the scenes of love. <br>
            Here dancing Ceres shakes her golden sheaves ; <br>
            Here Bacchus revels, deckt with viny leaves ; <br>
            Here wit's enchanting god, in laurel crown'd, <br>
            Wakes all the ravish'd hours with silver sound. <br>
            Ye fields, ye forests, own Dione's reign, <br>
            And Delia, huntress Delia, shun the plain.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <br>
            And those who always loved now love the more.</p>
          <p>Gay with the bloom of all her opening year, <br>
            The Queen at Hybla bids her throne appear, <br>
            And there presides ; and there the fav'rite band, <br>
            Her smiling Graces, share the great command. <br>
            Now, beauteous Hybla ! dress thy flowery beds <br>
            With all the pride the lavish season sheds; <br>
            Now all thy colours, all thy fragrance yield, <br>
            And rival Enna's aromatic field. <br>
            To fill the presence of the gentle court <br>
            From every quarter rural Nymphs resort, <br>
            From woods, from mountains, from these humble vales, <br>
            From waters curling with the wanton gales. <br>
            Pleased with the joyful train, the laughing Queen <br>
            In circles seats them round the bank of green ; <br>
            And, "lovely girls," she whispers, "guard your hearts; <br>
            ‘ My boy, though stript of arms, abounds in arts."</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <br>

          <p>Let tender grass in shaded alleys spread ; <br>
            Let early flowers erect their painted head ; <br>
            To-morrow's glory be to-morrow seen ; <br>
            That day old Ether wedded Earth in green.</p><pb n="296"/>
            
          <p>The vernal father bade the spring appear, <br>
            In clouds he coupled to produce the year ; <br>
            The sap descending o'er her bosom ran, <br>
            And all the various sorts of soul began <br>
            By wheels unknown to sight, by secret veins <br>
            Distilling life ; the fruitful goddess reigns <br>
            Through all the lovely realms of native day, <br>
            Through all the circled land and circling sea ; <br>
            With fertile seed she fill'd the pervious earth, <br>
            And ever fix'd the mystic ways of birth.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <br>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>'Twas she, the parent, to the Latian shore <br>
            Through various dangers Troy's remainder bore. <br>
            She won Lavinia for her warlike son, <br>
            And winning her, the Latian empire won. <br>
            She gave to Mars the maid whose honoured womb <br>
            Swell'd with the founder of immortal Rome. <br>
            Decoy'd by shows the Sabine dames she led, <br>
            And taught our vigorous youth the means to wed. <br>
            Hence sprung the Romans, hence the race divine <br>
            Through which great Cæsar draws his Julian line.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <br>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>In rural seats the soul of pleasure reigns ; <br>
            The love of Beauty fills the rural scenes ; <br>

            Drew first the breathings of a rural air, <br>
            Some pleasing meadow pregnant Beauty prest, <br>
            She laid her infant on its bowery breast; <br>
            From nature's sweets he supp'd the fragrant dew, <br>

          <p>Now bulls o'er stalks of broom extend their sides, <br>

            Now stately rams their fleecy consorts lead, <br>
            Who bleating follow through the wand'ring shade. <br>
            And now the goddess bids the birds appear, <br>
            Raise all their music, and salute the year ; <br>
            Then deep the swan begins, and deep the song <br>
            Runs o'er the water where he sails along; <br>
            While Philomela tunes a treble strain, <br>
            And from the poplar charms the listening plain. <br>
            We fancy love exprest at every note; <br>
            It melts, it warbles in her liquid throat. <br>
            Of barbarous Tereus she complains no more, <br>
            But sings for pleasure, as for grief before. <br>
            And still her graces rise, her airs extend, <br>
            And all is silence till the syren end. <br>
            How long in coming is my lovely spring ? <br>
            And when shall I, and when the swallow sing ? <br>
            Sweet Philomela, cease or here I sit, <br>
            And silent loose my rapturous hour of wit. <br>
            'Tis gone ; the fit retires, the flames decay; <br>
            My tuneful Phœbus flies averse away. <br>
            His own Amyclæ thus, as stories run, <br>
            But once was silent, and that once undone.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before, <br>
            And those who always loved, now love the more. <br>

          <p>LOVE he to-morrow, who loved never ; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>The spring appears, in which the earth <br>
            Receives a new harmonious birth ; <br>
            When all things mutual love unites ; <br>
            When birds perform their nuptial rites ; <br>
            And fruitful by her watery lover, <br>
            Each grove its tresses doth recover. <br>
            Love's Queen to-morrow, in the shade, <br>
            Which by these verdant trees is made, <br>
             <pb n="298"/>
            Their sprouting tops in wreaths shall bind, <br>
            And myrtles into arbours wind; <br>
            To-morrow, raised on a high throne, <br>
            Dione shall her laws make known.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who bath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>Then the round ocean's foaming flood <br>
            Immingled with celestial blood, <br>
            ’Mongst the blue purple of the main, <br>
            And horses whom two feet sustain, <br>
            Rising Dione did beget <br>
            With fruitful waters dropping wet.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>With flowery jewels everywhere <br>
            She paints the purple-eolour'd year ; <br>
            She, when the rising bud receives <br>
            Favonius' breath, thrusts forth the leaves, <br>
            The naked roof with these t' adorn ; <br>
            She the transparent dew o' th' morn, <br>
            Which the thick air of night still uses <br>
            To leave behind, in rain diffuses; <br>
            These tears with orient brightness shine, <br>
            Whilst they with trembling weight decline, <br>
            Whose every drop, into a small <br>
            Clear orb distill'd, sustains its fall. <br>
            Pregnant with these the bashful rose <br>
            Her purple blushes doth disclose. <br>
            The drops of falling dew that are <br>
            Shed in calm nights by every star, <br>
            She in her humid mantle holds, <br>
            And then her virgin leaves unfolds. <br>
            I' th' morn, by her command, each maid <br>
            With dewy roses is array'd; <br>
            Which from Cythera's crimson blood, <br>
            From the soft kisses Love bestow'd, <br>
            From jewels, from the radiant flame, <br>
            And the sun's purple lustre, came. <br>

            She to her spouse shall married be <br>

            Her fiery garment's purple dye.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>The goddess bade the nymphs remove <br>
            Unto the shady myrtle grove ; <br>
            The boy goes with the maids, yet none <br>
            Will trust, or think Love tame is grown, <br>
            If they perceive that anywhere <br>
            He arrows doth about him bear. <br>
            Go fearless, nymphs, for Love hath laid <br>
            Aside his arms, and tame is made. <br>
            His weapons by command resigned, <br>
            Naked to go he is enjoin'd, <br>
            Lest he hurt any by his craft, <br>
            Either with flame, or bow, or shaft. <br>
            But yet take heed, young nymphs, beware <br>
            You trust him not, for Cupid's fair, <br>
            Lest by his beauty you be harm'd ; <br>
            Love naked is completely arm'd.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>Fair Venus virgins sends to thee, <br>
            Indued with equal modesty: <br>
            One only thing we thee desire, <br>
            Chaste Delia, for a while retire ; <br>
            That the wide forest, that the wood, <br>
            May be unstain'd with savage blood. <br>
            She would with prayers herself attend thee, <br>
            But that she knew she could not bend thee; <br>
            She would thyself to come have pray'd, <br>
            Did these delights beseem a maid. <br>
            Now might'st thou see with solemn rites <br>
            The Chorus celebrate three nights ; <br>
            ’Mongst troops whom equal pleasure crowns, <br>

            All night we wholly must employ <br>
            In vigils, and in songs of joy; <br>
            None but Dione must bear sway <br>
            Amongst the woods; Delia, give way</p>

            To-morrow, who bath loved, persevere</p>
          <p>She the tribunal did command <br>
            Deck'd with Hyblæan flowers should stand ; <br>
            She will in judgment sit; the Graces <br>

            Hybla, thy flowers pour forth, whatever <br>
            Was brought thee by the welcome year; <br>
            Hybla, thy flowery garment spread, <br>
            Wide as is Enna's fruitful mead; <br>
            Maids of the country here will be; <br>
            Maids of the mountain come to see; <br>
            Hither resort all such as dwell <br>
            Either in grove, or wood, or well. <br>
            The wing'd boy's mother every one <br>
            Commands in order to sit down ; <br>
            Charging the virgins that they must <br>
            In nothing Love, though naked, trust.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>Let the fresh covert of a shade <br>
            Be by these early flowers displayed, <br>
            To-morrow (which with sports and play <br>
            We keep) was Æther’s wedding day ; <br>
            When first the father of the spring <br>
            Did out of clouds the young year bring. <br>
            The husband Shower then courts his spouse, <br>
            And in her sacred bosom flows, <br>
            That all which that vast body bred <br>

            All things both governs and sustains. <br>
            Piercing through the unsounded sea, <br>
            And earth, and highest heaven, she <br>
            All places with her power doth fill, <br>
            Which through each part she doth distil; <br>
            And to the world the mystic ways <br>
            Of all production open lays.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever</p>
          <p>She to the Latins did transfer <br>
            The Trojan nephews; and by her <br>
            Was the Laurentian virgin won, <br>
            And joined in marriage to her son. <br>
            By her assistance did Mars gain <br>

            To marriage Romulus betrayed <br>
            The Sabine women, by her aid, <br>
            (Of Romans the wide-spreading stem,) <br>
            And in the long descent of them <br>
            In whom that offspring was dilated, <br>

            The goddess wills not silent be. <br>
            The vocal swans on every lake, <br>
            With their hoarse voice a harsh sound make; <br>
            And Tereus' hapless maid beneath <br>
            The poplar's shade her song doth breathe; <br>
            Such as might well persuade thee, love <br>
            Doth in those trembling accents move; <br>
            Not that the sister in those strains <br>
            Of the inhuman spouse complains. <br>
            We silent are whilst she doth sing, <br>
            How long in coming is my spring? <br>
            When will the time arrive, that I <br>
            May swallow-like my voice untie ? <br>
            My muse for being silent flies me, <br>
            And Phcebus will no longer prize me: <br>
            So did Amielse once, whilst all <br>
            Silence observed, through silence fall.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <br>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever. <br>

          <p>THE glittering ore let others vainly heap, <br>
            O'er fertile vales extend th' enclosing mound; <br>
            With dread of neighboring foes forsake their sleep, <br>
            And start aghast at every trumpet's sound.</p>
          <p>Me humbler scenes delight, and calmer days; <br>
            A tranquil life fair poverty secure ! <br>
            Then boast, my hearth, a small but cheerful blaze, <br>
            And, riches grasp who will, let me be poor.</p>
          <p>Nor yet be hope a stranger to my door, <br>
            But o'er my roof, bright goddess, still preside ! <br>
            With many a bounteous autumn heap my floor, <br>
            And swell my vats with must, a purple tide.</p>
          <p>My tender vines I'll plant with early care, <br>
            And choicest apples with a skilful hand; <br>
            Nor blush, a rustic, oft to guide the share, <br>
            Or goad the tardy ox along the land.</p>
          <p>Let me, a simple swain, ,with honest pride, <br>
            If chance a lambkin from its dam should roam, <br>
            Or sportful kid, the little wanderer chide, <br>
            And in my bosom bear exulting home.</p>
          <p>Here Pales I bedew with milky showers, <br>
            Lustrations yearly for my shepherd pay, <br>
            Revere each antique stone bedeck'd with flowers <br>
            That bounds the field, or points the doubtful way.</p><pb n="304"/>
            
          <p>My grateful fruits, the earliest of the year, <br>
            Before the rural god shall duly wait. <br>
            From Ceres' gifts I'll cull each browner ear, <br>
            And hang a wheaten wreath before her gate.</p>
          <p>The ruddy god shall save my fruit from stealth, <br>
            And far away each little plunderer scare : <br>
            And you, the guardians once of ampler wealth, <br>
            My household gods, shall still my off'rings share.</p>
          <p>My numerous herds that wanton'd o'er the mead <br>
            The choicest falling then could richly yield; <br>
            Now scarce I spare a little lamb to bleed <br>
            A mighty victim for my scanty field.</p>
          <p>And yet a lamb shall bleed, while, ranged around, <br>
            The village youths shall stand in order meet, <br>
            With rustic hymns, ye gods, your praise resound, <br>
            And future crops and future wines entreat,</p>
          <p>Then come, ye powers, nor scorn my frugal board, <br>
            Nor yet the gifts clean earthen bowls convey; <br>
            With these the first of men the gods adored, <br>
            And form'd their simple shape of ductile clay.</p>
          <p>My little flock, ye wolves, ye robbers, spare, <br>
            Too mean a plunder to deserve your toil; <br>
            For wealthier herds the nightly theft prepare; <br>
            There seek a nobler prey, and richer spoil.</p>
          <p>For treasured wealth, nor stores of golden wheat, <br>
            The hoard of frugal sires, I vainly call; <br>
            A little farm be mine, a cottage neat, <br>
            And wonted couch where balmy sleep may falL</p>
          <p>“What joy to hear the tempest howl in vain, <br>
            And clasp a fearful mistress to my breast; <br>
            Or lull'd to slumber by the beating rain, <br>
            Secure and happy sink at last to rest."</p>
          <p>These joys be mine !—0 grant me only these, <br>
            And give to others bags of shining gold, <br>
            Whose steely heart can brave the boist'rous seas, <br>
            The storm wide-wasting, or the stiffening cold.</p>
          <p>Content with little, I would rather stay <br>
            Than spend long months amid the wat'ry waste; <br>
             <pb n="305"/>
            In cooling shades elude the scorching ray, <br>
            Beside some fountain's gliding waters placed.</p>
          <p>Oh perish rather all that's rich and rare, <br>
            The diamond quarry, and the golden vein, <br>
            Than that my absence cost one precious tear, <br>
            Or give some gentle maid a moment's pain.</p>
          <p>With glittering spoils, Messala, gild thy dome, <br>
            Be thine the noble task to lead the brave ; <br>
            A lovely foe me captive holds at home, <br>
            Chain'd to her scornful gate, a watchful slave.</p>
          <p>Inglorious post!-and yet I heed not fame : <br>
            Th' applause of crowds for Delia I'd resign: <br>
            To live with thee I'd bear the coward's name, <br>
            Nor 'midst the scorn of nations once repine.</p>
          <p>With thee to live I'd mock the ploughman's toil. <br>
            Or on some lonely mountain tend my sheep ; <br>
            At night I'd lay me on the flinty soil, <br>
            And happy 'midst thy dear embraces sleep.</p>
          <p>What drooping lover heeds the Tyrian bed, <br>
            While the long night is pass'd with many a sigh; <br>
            Nor softest down with richest carpets spread, <br>
            Nor whisp'ring rills can close the weeping eye.</p>
          <p>Of threefold iron were his rugged frame, <br>
            Who, when he might thy yielding heart obtain, <br>
            Could yet attend the calls of empty fame, <br>
            Or follow arms in quest of sordid gain.</p>
          <p>Unenvied let him drive the vanquish'd host, <br>
            Through captive lands his conquering armies lead ; <br>
            Unenvied wear the robe with gold emboss'cl, <br>
            And guide with solemn state his foaming steed.</p>
          <p>Oh may I view thee with life's parting ray, <br>
            And thy dear hand with dying ardour press: <br>
            Sure thou wilt weep-and on thy lover's clay, <br>
            With breaking heart, print many a tender kiss !</p>
          <p>Sure thou wilt weep-and woes unntter’d feel, <br>
            When on the pile thou seest thy lover laid ! <br>
            For well I know, nor flint, nor ruthless steel, <br>
            Can arm the breast of such a gentle maid. <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>
            </p>
          <p>From the sad pomp, what youth, what pitying fair, <br>
            Returning slow, can tender tears refrain ? <br>
            O Delia, spare thy cheeks, thy tresses spare, <br>
            Nor give my ling'ring shade a world of pain.</p>
          <p>But now while smiling hours the Fates bestow, <br>
            Let love, dear maid, our gentle hearts unite ! <br>
            Soon death will come and strike the fatal blow; <br>
            Unseen his head, and veil'd in shades of night.</p>
          <p>Soon creeping age will bow the lover's frame, <br>
            And tear the myrtle chaplet from his brow: <br>
            With hoary locks ill suits the youthful flame, <br>
            The soft persuasion, or the ardent vow.</p>
          <p>Now the fair queen of gay desire is ours, <br>
            And lends our follies an indulgent smile : <br>
            'Tis lavish youth's t' enjoy the frolic hours, <br>
            The wanton revel and the midnight broil.</p>
          <p>Your chief, my friends and fellow-soldiers, I <br>
            To these light wars will lead you boldly on: <br>
            Far hence, ye trumpets, sound, and banners fly; <br>
            To those who covet wounds and fame begone.</p>
          <p>And bear them fame and wounds ; and riches bear ; <br>
            There are that fame and wounds and riches prize. <br>
            For me, while I possess one plenteous year, <br>
            I'll wealth and meagre want alike despise. GRAINGER.</p>

            Me let my easy poverty release <br>

          <p>Myself th' industrious husbandman will be, <br>

            And in due season plant the tender vine; <br>
            Nor e'er the joys of solitude resign. <br>
            Nor shall I blush the rustic fork to wield, <br>
            Or goad the sluggish ox to plough the field; <br>
            Or in my arms to bear the straggling lamb, <br>
            Or tender kid, home to the mourning dam. <br>
            With rural rites my careful shepherd here <br>
            I'm used to lustrate each revolving year; <br>
            Propitious sacred Pales to retain, <br>
            I sprinkle milk upon the rising grain. <br>
            For still I worship wheresoe'er I see <br>
            An ancient stone, or remnant of a tree, <br>
            With flowery garlands crown'd in open field, <br>
            Or where three ways decisive limits yield. <br>
            The rural gods as offerings shall receive <br>
            The earliest fruit my loaded orchards give. <br>
            Thy temple gates, 0 Ceres, I '11 adorn <br>
            With auburn wreaths of ripen'd ears of corn. <br>
            And in my orchard let Priapus stand <br>
            With the dire sickle in his ruddy hand, <br>
            To scare the noxious birds from off my land. <br>
            And you, my household gods, shall have your due, <br>
            More spreading fields were once preserved by you. <br>
            The guardians once of large extended plains, <br>
            Now one small farm your kind protection gains. <br>
            A cow-calf then for numerous herds of kine <br>
            Fell a lustration to your powers divine. <br>
            A lambkin now at your blessed altar dies, <br>
            Of narrow soil the mighty sacrifice. <br>
            A lambkin to your deities shall fall, <br>
            While round the rustic youths on you shall call. <br>
            " Good harvest and good vintage, oh ! bestow ! <br>

            A little crop my wishes will supply, <br>

            Who can the fury of the billows dare, <br>

            My wishes move within a narrow bound, <br>
            Content at last with little I have found. <br>
            The tedious paths to wealth no more I'll stray, <br>
            My easy soul abhors that rugged way. <br>
            Beneath the shadow of some spreading tree, <br>
            From fear, from hope, from toil, from wishes free, <br>
            Upon the brink of a cool tumbling stream, <br>
            I shun the dog-star's fierce and sultry gleam.</p>
          <p>Oh ! perish rather, all ye glittering gold, <br>
            And jewels which fond mortals precious hold, <br>
            Than any tender she let fall a tear, <br>

            In thee, Messala, war has wondrous charms, <br>
            While land and sea are conquer'd by thy arms; <br>
            When as the crown of all thy glorious toils, <br>
            Thou seest thy house adorn'd with hostile spoils <br>
            Bound with Love's fetters, here will I remain, <br>
            I cannot break soft beauty's lovely chain. <br>
            No lust of praise invades my peaceful breast, <br>
            Whilst thus with thee, my Delia, I am blest. <br>
            Of sloth and idleness I court the fame; <br>

            If thou, my Delia, still with me remain, <br>

            I can, when thou art by, on lonely downs <br>
            Feed my own herds, secure from Delia's frowns, <br>
            While thee I can within my bosom keep, <br>
            I on the rugged ground can calmly sleep. <br>
            Of what avail are Tyrian beds of down, <br>
            When love averse will only give a frown ? <br>

            (In chase of spoils) of horrid martial arms : <br>
            Though his victorious troops subdue the foe,. <br>
            And wait his nod where'er he please to go; <br>
            Though clad in silver, cover'd o'er with gold, <br>
            Upon his prancing horse, most graceful to behold <br>
            Thee let me view when I resign my breath, <br>
            Thee let me grasp e'en in the pangs of death; <br>
            And press, with fah'ring hands, thy lovely arms, <br>
            In death my Delia still would have her charms. <br>
            You'd weep, my Delia, when you saw me die, <br>
            Beheld me on my bed expiring lie; <br>
            On my cold lips thy kisses thou wouldst fix, <br>
            While flowing tears with thy dear kisses mix. <br>
            Yes, you would weep, you would let fall a tear; <br>
            Those lovely eyes a drooping grief would wear. <br>
            I know thee well, all tenderness thou art, <br>
            Nor steel, nor stone, in thee have any part, <br>
            But love and soft compassion fill thy heart. <br>
            No, from my funeral no kind youth would go, <br>
            Nor tender virgin, ere their tears did flow. <br>
            Spare, spare my Manes, gentle Delia, spare <br>
            Thy lovely locks, thy bright, dishevell'd hair, <br>

            With hoary hairs soft toys will not agree. <br>

          <p>LET others pile their yellow ingots high, <br>
            And see their cultured acres round them spread; <br>
            While hostile borderers draw their anxious eye, <br>

          <p>In pious rite; and, when the year anew <br>
            Matures the blossom on the budding spray, <br>
            I bear the peasant's god his grateful due, <br>

            Then, for unnumber'd herds, a calf was slain; <br>
            Now to your altars is a lamb consigned.</p>

            While round it shout the youthful sons of toil, <br>
            " Hail! grant the harvest! grant the generous wine !”</p>
          <p>Content with little, I no more would tread <br>
            The lengthening road, but shun the summer day, <br>
            Where some o'er-branching tree might shade my head, <br>
            And watch the murmuring rivulet glide away.</p>
          <p>Nor could I blush to wield the rustic prong, <br>
            The lingering oxen goad; or some stray lamb, <br>
            Embosom'd in my garment, bear along, <br>
            Or kid forgotten by its heedless dam.</p>
          <p>Spare my small flock! ye thieves and wolves, assail <br>
            The wealthier cotes, that ampler booty h Id ; <br>
            Ne'er for my shepherd due lustrations fail; <br>
            I soothe with milk the goddess of the fold.</p>

            Let me the oxen yoke ; oh come with me ! <br>
            On desert mountains I will feed my fold.</p>
          <p>And, while I press'd thee in my tender arms, <br>
            Sweet were my slumber on the rugged ground: <br>
            What boots the purple couch, if cruel charms <br>
            In wakeful tears the midnight hours have drown'd?</p>
          <p>Not the soft plume can yield the limbs repose, <br>

          <p>Iron is he who might thy form possess, <br>
            Yet flies to arms, and thirsts for plunder's gains; <br>
            What though his spear Cilieian squadrons press, <br>
            What though his tent be pitch'd on conquer'd plains ?</p>
          <p>In gold and silver mail conspicuous he <br>
            May stride the steed, that, pawing, spurs the sand; <br>
            May I my last looks fondly bend on thee, <br>
            And grasp thee with my dying, faltering hand !</p>
          <p>And thou wilt weep when, cold, I press the bier, <br>
            That soon shall on the flaming pyre be thrown ; <br>
            And print the kiss, and mingle many a tear; <br>
            Not thine a breast of steel, a heart of stone.</p>
          <p>Yes—thou wilt weep. No youth shall thence return <br>
            With tearless eye, no virgin homeward wend : <br>
            But thou forbear to violate my urn, <br>
            Spare thy soft cheeks, nor those loose tresses rend.</p>
          <p>Now fate permits, now blend the sweet embrace: <br>
            Death, cowl'd in darkness, creeps with stealing tread , <br>
            III suits with sluggish age love’s sprightly grace, <br>
            And murmur'd fondness with a hoary head.</p>
          <p>The light amour be mine ; the shiver'd door ; <br>
            The midnight fray; ye trumps and standards, hence ! <br>
            Here is my camp ; bleed they who thirst for ore: <br>

            Asleep, take heed no whisper stirs the air, <br>
            For waked, my boy, I wake to heart-felt care. <br>
            Now is my Delia watch'd by ruthless spies, <br>
            And the gate, bolted, all access denies. <br>
            Relentless gate ! may storms of wind and rain <br>

            Then recollect my many wreaths of yore, <br>
            How oft you've seen me weep, insensate door! <br>

          <p>In vain I plead !-dare then my Delia rise ! <br>
            Love aids the dauntless, and will blind your spies! <br>
            Those who the godhead's soft behests obey, <br>
            Steal from their pillows unobserv'd away ; <br>
            On tip-toe traverse unobserv'd the floor ; <br>
            The key turn noiseless, and unfold the door: <br>
            In vain the jealous each precaution take, <br>
            Their speaking fingers assignations make. <br>
            Nor will the god impart to all his aid: <br>
            Love hates the fearful, hates the lazy maid ; <br>
            But through sly windings and unpractis'd ways <br>
            His bold knight-errants to their wish conveys: <br>
            For those whom he with expectation fires <br>
            No ambush frightens, and no labour tires; <br>
            Sacred the dangers of the dark they dare, <br>
            No robbers stop them, and no bravoes scare. <br>
            Though wintry tempests howl, by love secure, <br>
            The howling tempest I with ease endure: <br>
            No watching hurts me, if my Delia smile, <br>
            Soft turn the gate, aud beckon me the while.</p>
          <p>She's mine. Be blind, ye ramblers of the night, <br>
            Lest angry Venus snatch your guilty sight: <br>
            The goddess bids her votaries'joys to be <br>
            From every casual interruption free : <br>
            With prying steps alarm us not, retire, <br>
            Nor glare your torches, nor our names inquire: <br>
            Or if ye know, deny, by heaven above, <br>
            Nor dare divulge the privacies of love. <br>
            From blood and seas vindictive Venus sprung, <br>
            And sure destruction waits the blabbing tongue ! <br>
            Nay, should they prate, you, Delia, need not fear; <br>
            Your lord (a sorceress swore) should give no ear ! <br>
            By potent spells she cleaves the sacred ground, <br>
            And shuddering spectres wildly roam around ! <br>
            I've seen her tear the planets from the sky ! <br>
            Seen lightning backward at her bidding fly ! <br>
            She calls ? from blazing pyres the corse descends, <br>
            And, re-enliven’d, clasps his wondering friends ! <br>
            The friends she gathers with a magic yell, <br>
            Then with aspersions frights them back to hell! <br>
             <pb n="315"/>
            She wills,—glad summer gilds the frozen pole ! <br>
            She wills,-in summer wintry tempests roll! <br>
            She knows ('tis true) Medea’s awful spell! <br>
            She knows to vanquish the fierce guards of hell! <br>
            To me she gave a charm for lovers meet, <br>
            (" Spit thrice, my fair, and thrice the charm repeat.”) <br>
            Us in soft dalliance should your lord surprise, <br>
            By this imposed on he'd renounce his eyes ! <br>
            But bless no rival, or th' affair is known ; <br>
            This incantation me befriends alone. <br>
            Nor stopped she here; but swore, if I'd agree, <br>
            By charms or herbs to set thy lover free. <br>
            With dire lustrations she began the rite ! <br>
            (Serenely shone the planet of the night,) <br>
            The magic gods she call'd with hellish sound, <br>
            A sable sacrifice distain'd the ground— <br>
            I stopp'd the spell: I must not, cannot part: <br>
            I begg'd her aid to gain a mutual heart. GRAINGER.</p>

            Thou too, my Delia, boldly brave thy guards- <br>
            Venus herself the dauntless pair rewards ; <br>
            And helps the boy who jealous walls explores, <br>
            And helps the girl who opes forbidden doors!</p>
          <p>To glide in silence from the downy bed, <br>

            Betray the cuckold-making aid of heaven. <br>
            Such arts are theirs who fly from sluggard ease, <br>
            Cross the dark moor, and in the tempest freeze, <br>
            Till, safely nestling in their fair one's arms, <br>
            They feel the glowing change exalt her charms.</p>
          <p>No lawless robber in my path shall rove, <br>
            For sacred is the messenger of love ; <br>
            Nor storm nor howling rain shall cloud my road, <br>
            If Delia beckon to the dear abode; <br>
            Draw the soft bolt, and silently advise <br>
            My sounding footsteps with her fearful eyes, <br>
            With eager finger on her lip imprest, <br>
            Impatient brow, and quickly-beating breast. <br>
            Veil, veil your lamps, whoever travel nigh, <br>
            The thefts of Venus shun the curious eye. <br>
            Nor tread too loudly, nor inquire my name, <br>
            Nor to my face advance your taper's flame. <br>
            And ye, who chance to see, the sight forswear, <br>
            And vow by all the gods ye were not there. <br>
            The prating babbler shall confess with pain <br>
            That Venus issued from the savage main. <br>
            Nay, e'en your lord the tell-tale shall distrust, <br>
            And scorn the lying rumour of your lust.</p>
          <p>So sang the witch, whose prophecy divine <br>
            Assured my hopes, and made thee wholly mine. <br>
            She draws the stars from heaven with influence strong, <br>
            And turns the course of rapid streams by song ; <br>
            Cleaves the firm ground, the dead with life inspires, <br>
            Bids rattling bones start forth from burial fires, <br>
            With magic yell the gathering ghosts commands, <br>
            Or purifies with milk their parting bands. <br>
            Wills she—the clouds of thunder disappear ! <br>

            Sole mistress she of dire Medea's charms, <br>
            Her power alone the dogs of hell disarms. <br>
            A rhyme she framed, which if thou thrice rehearse, <br>
            Thy lord shall yield such homage to the verse, <br>
             <pb n="317"/>
            That not a tale his spies relate of me, <br>
            No, nor the hot embrace his eyes may see, <br>

            To snatch the slightest favour from my fair, <br>
            Her jealous lord shall every theft perceive, <br>
            Know all lie suffers, all he hears believe.</p>
          <p>Shall I too trust the sorceress' potent art, <br>
            By herb, or song, to free my captive heart? <br>
            The lustral torches blazed at midnight hour, <br>
            Fell the black victim to each magic power, <br>
            And thus I pray’d—“Oh ! cure me not of love ! <br>

            With love's victorious joys at last be crown'd:</p>
          <p>With sudden step let none our bliss surprise, <br>
            Or check the freedom of secure delight- <br>
            Rash man, beware, and shut thy curious eyes, <br>
            Lest angry Venus snatch their guilty sight.</p>
          <p>But shouldst thou see, th' important secret hide, <br>
            Though questioned by the powers of earth and heaven <br>
            The prating tongue shall love's revenge abide, <br>
            Still sue for grace, and never be forgiven.</p>
          <p>A wizard dame, the lover's ancient friend, <br>
            With magic charm has deaft thy husband's ear; <br>
            At her command I saw the stars descend, <br>
            And winged lightnings stop in mid career.</p>
          <p>I saw her stamp and cleave the solid ground, <br>
            While ghastly spectres round us wildly roam ; <br>
            I saw them hearken to her potent sound, <br>
            Till, scared at day, they sought their dreary home.</p>
          <p>At her command the vigorous summer pines, <br>
            And wintry clouds obscure the hopeful year; <br>
            At her strong bidding, gloomy winter shines, <br>
            And vernal roses on the snows appear.</p>
          <p>She gave these charms, which I on thee bestow; <br>
            They dim the eye, and dull the jealous mind; <br>
            For me they make a husband nothing know, <br>
            For me, and only me, they make him blind.</p>
          <p>But what did most this faithful heart surprise, <br>
            Site boasted that her skill could set it free: <br>
            This faithful heart the boasted freedom flies; <br>
            How could it venture to abandon thee ? HAMMOND.</p>

          <p>WHILE you, Messala, plough th' Ægean sea, <br>
            Oh sometimes kindly deign to think of me: <br>
            Me, hapless me, Phæacian shores detain, <br>
            Unknown, unpitied, and oppress'd with pain. <br>
             <pb n="319"/>
            Yet spar.- me, death, ah spare me, and retire: <br>
            No weeping mother's here to light my pyre: <br>
            Here is no sister, with a sister's woe, <br>
            Rich Syrian odours on the pile to throw: <br>
            But chief, my soul's soft partner is not here, <br>
            Her locks to loose, and sorrow o'er my bier.</p>
          <p>What though fair Delia my return implored, <br>
            Each fane frequented, and each god adored ; <br>
            What though they bade me every peril brave, <br>
            And Fortune thrice auspicious omens gave; <br>
            All could not dry my tender Delia's tears, <br>
            Suppress her sighs, or calm her anxious fears; <br>
            E'en as I strove to minister relief, <br>
            Unconscious tears proclaim'd my heart-felt grief: <br>
            Urged still to go, a thousand shifts I made, <br>
            Birds now, now festivals my voyage stay'd: <br>
            Or, if I struck my foot against the door, <br>
            Straight I return'd, and wisdom was no more. <br>
            Forbid by Cupid, let no swain depart; <br>
            Cupid is vengeful, and will wring his heart.</p>
          <p>What do your offerings now, my fair, avail ? <br>
            Your Isis heeds not, and your cymbals fail! <br>
            What though array'd in sacred robes you stood, <br>
            Fled man's embrace, and sought the purest flood? <br>
            While this I write, I sensibly decay,­ <br>
            " Assist me, Isis, drive my pains away : <br>
            That you can every mortal ill remove, <br>
            The numerous tablets in your temple prove: <br>
            So shall my Delia, veil'd in votive white, <br>
            Before your threshold sit for many a night; <br>
            And twice a day, her tresses all unbound, <br>
            Amid your votaries famed, your praises sound: <br>
            Safe to my household gods may I return, <br>
            And incense monthly on their altars burn."</p>

            Secure the pine upon the mountain grew, <br>
            Nor yet o'er billows in the ocean flew; <br>
            Then every clime a wild abundance bore, <br>

             <pb n="320"/>
            For then no steed to feel the bit was broke. <br>
            Then had no steer submitted to the yoke ; <br>
            No house had gates, (blest times !) and, in the grounds, <br>
            No scanty land-marks parcelled out the bounds: <br>
            From every oak redundant honey ran, <br>
            And ewes spontaneous bore their milk to man: <br>
            No deathful arms were forged, no war was waged, <br>
            No rapine plunder'd, no ambition raged. <br>
            How changed, alas ! Now cruel Jove commands; <br>
            Gold fires the soul, and falchions arm our hands: <br>
            Each day, the main unnumber’d lives destroys: <br>
            And slaughter, daily, o'er her myriads joys. <br>
            Yet spare me, Jove, I ne'er disowned thy sway, <br>
            I ne'er was perjur'd ; spare me, Jove, I pray.</p>
          <p>But, if the Sisters have pronounced my doom, <br>
            Inscribed be these upon my humble tomb. <br>
            " Lo ! here inurn’d a youthful poet lies, <br>

            Far from the lov'd Messala, whom to please <br>
            Tibullus followed over land and seas."</p>
          <p>Then Love my ghost (for Love I still obey'd) <br>
            Will grateful usher to th' Elysian shade : <br>
            There joy and ceaseless revelry prevail; <br>
            There soothing music floats on every gale; <br>
            There painted warblers hop from spray to spray, <br>
            And, wildly-pleasing, swell the general lay: <br>
            There every hedge, untaught, with cassia blooms, <br>
            And scents the ambient air with rich perfumes: <br>
            There every mead a various plenty yields ; <br>
            There lavish Flora paints the purple fields: <br>
            With ceaseless light a brighter Phœbus glows, <br>
            No sickness tortures, and no ocean flows; <br>
            But youths associate with the gentle fair, <br>
            And stung with pleasure to the shade repair: <br>
            With them Love wanders wheresoe'er they stray, <br>
            Provokes to rapture, and inflames the play: <br>
            But chief, the constant few, by death betrayed, <br>
            Reign, crown'd with myrtle, monarchs of the shade</p>
          <p>Not so the wicked; far they drag their chains, <br>
            By black lakes sever'd from the blissful plains; <br>

            Those should they pass, impassable the gate <br>
            Where Cerberus howls, grim sentinel of fate. <br>
            There snake-hair'd fiends with whips patrol around, <br>
            Rack'd anguish bellows, and the deeps resound: <br>
            There he, who dared to tempt the queen of heaven, <br>
            Upon an ever-turning wheel is driven : <br>
            The Danaids there still strive huge casks to fill, <br>
            But strive in vain, the casks elude their skill: <br>
            There Pelops' sire, to quench his thirsty fires, <br>
            Still tries the flood, and still the flood retires: <br>
            There vultures tear the bow'Is, and drink the gore, <br>
            Of Tityus, stretch'd enormous on the shore. <br>
            Dread love, as vast as endless be their pain <br>
            Who tempt my fair, or wish a long campaign.</p>
          <p>0 let no rival your affections share, <br>
            Long as this bosom beats, my lovely fair ! <br>
            Still on you let your prudent nurse attend ; <br>
            She'll guard your honour, she's our common friend. <br>
            Her tales of love your sorrowings will allay, <br>
            And, in my absence, make my Delia gay: <br>
            Let her o'er all your virgin-train preside, <br>
            She'll praise th' industrious, and the lazy chide. <br>
            But see ! on all enfeebling languors creep ; <br>
            Their distaffs drop, they yawn, they nod, they sleep. <br>
            Then, if the destinies propitious prove, <br>
            Then will I rush, all passion, on my love: <br>
            My wish'd return no messenger shall tell, <br>
            I'll seem, my fair, as if from heaven I fell. <br>
            A soft confusion flushes all your charms, <br>
            Your graceful dishabille my bosom warms, <br>
            You, Delia, fly and clasp me in your arms.</p>
          <p>For this surprise, ye powers of love, I pray, <br>
            Post on, Aurora, bring the rosy day. GRAINGER.</p>

          <p>How well they lived in Saturn's golden times. <br>
            Ere earth lay open to her farthest climes; <br>
            Ere hollow pine-trees mounted on the wave, <br>
            And to the wind their swelling canvass gave; <br>

            No lordly bull then dragg'd the pond rous wain, <br>
            Nor noble horse obey'd the slavish rein ; <br>
            No house was guarded by the jealous wall, <br>
            No selfish landmark robb'd the wealth of all. <br>
            Spontaneous oaks distill'd their honey'd dews, <br>
            Their milk was offer'd by the teeming ewes : <br>
            War had not yet his iron front displayed, <br>
            Nor savage craft contrived the murd'rous blade. <br>
            Danger and death pursue the thunderer's reign, <br>
            And cross, by countless paths, the land and main. <br>
            Oh ! spare me, Jove ! no perjured tongue is mine, <br>
            No impious curses hurl'd at names divine. <br>

          <p>But I, who living yield to gentle love, <br>
            Dying shall seek the blest Elysian grove. <br>
            There tuneful choirs o'er verdant meadows stray, <br>
            And dance and song delight th' immortal day; <br>
            Uncultured cassia scents the teeming ground, <br>

            Renew the wonted interchange of joy. <br>

            There, on the rapid wheel is lust impaled, <br>

            There thirsting Tantalus, with eager eyes <br>
            And outstretch’d hands, pursues the stream that flies. <br>
            There the false brides who shed their husbands' blood, <br>
            Through hollow vessels pour the ceaseless flood. <br>

            There be the wretch who wishes me to rove, <br>
            In painful absence from my only love.</p>
          <p>But rest for ever pure, my lovely bride, <br>
            Thy aged nurse still watching at thy side, <br>
            Telling sweet tales of seasons long gone by- <br>
            While, at their lamps, the circling damsels ply <br>
            The curious labours of the length’ning thread, <br>
            Or o'er the distaff bend their drowsy head. <br>
            Then, on a sudden, will thy lover come, <br>
            As if from heaven descending to his home: <br>
            No courier's speed my Delia shall prepare, <br>
            But in her chance undress I'll find the fair. <br>
            Then will she run these smiling eyes to meet, <br>
            Loose her dark locks, and bare her snowy feet. <br>

            Shall prove, believe the bard, or soon, or late, <br>

            My boasts of manhood, boasts of bliss are vain; <br>
            Back to my bondage I return again ! <br>
            And like a top am whirl'd, which boys, for sport. <br>

          <p>What can atone, my fair, for crimes like these ? <br>
            I'll bear with patience, use me as you please! <br>
            Yet, by Love's shafts, and by your braided hair, <br>
            By all the joys we stole, your suppliant spare. <br>
            When sickness dimm'd of late your radiant eyes, <br>
            My restless, fond petitions won the skies. <br>

            And thrice the rite, with songs, th' enchantress bound: <br>
            The cake, by me thrice sprinkled, put to flight <br>
            The death-denouncing phantoms of the night: <br>
            And I nine times, in linen garbs array'd, <br>
            In silent night, nine times to Trivia pray^d. <br>
            What did I not ? Yet what reward have I ? <br>
            You love another, your preserver fly ! <br>

            I fondly thought, sweet maid, oh thought in vain ! <br>
            With you to live a blithesome village swain. <br>
            When yellow Ceres asks the reaper's hand, <br>

            Delia will keep, when hinds unload the vine, <br>
            The choicest grapes for me, the richest wine: <br>

            To clasp some prattler of my menial train : <br>
            With pious care will load each rural shrine, <br>
            For ripen'd crops a golden sheaf assign, <br>
            Gates for my fold, rich clusters for my vine: <br>
            No, no domestic care shall touch my soul; <br>
            You, Delia, reign despotic o'er the whole ; <br>
            And will Messala fly from pomp of state, <br>
            And deign to enter at my lowly gate ? <br>
            The choicest fruitage that my trees afford <br>
            Delia will cull herself to deck the board; <br>
            And wondering, such transcendent worth to see, <br>
            The fruit present, thy blushing hand-maid she.</p>
          <p>Such were the fond chimeras of my brain, <br>
            Which now the winds have wafted o'er the main. <br>

            I stole no garland from her holy fine: <br>
            For crimes like these I'd abject crawl the ground, <br>
            Kiss her dread threshold, and my forehead wound.</p>
          <p>But ye who, falsely wise, deride my pains, <br>
            Beware; your hour approaches-love has chains. <br>
            I've known the young, who ridiculed his rage, <br>

            Each art I've known them try to win the fair, <br>
            Smooth their hoarse voice, and dress their scanty hair: <br>
            I've known them, in the street, her maid detain; <br>
            And weeping, beg her to assist their pain. <br>
            At such preposterous love each school-boy sneers ; <br>

          <p>LOVE still invites me with a smiling eye ! <br>
            Beneath his smiles what pains and anguish lie ! <br>
            Yet since the gods, dread power, must yield to thee, <br>
            What laurels canst thou gain from conquering me ? <br>
            Me Delia loved ; but by thy subtle wiles, <br>
            The fair, in secret, on another smiles : <br>
            That my suspicion's false, 'tis true, she swears ; <br>
            And backs her imprecations with her tears ! <br>
            False fair, your oaths and Syren tears refrain ; <br>
            Your Syren tears and oaths no credit gain ; <br>
            For when your lord suspected me of yore, <br>
            As much you wept, as many oaths you swore.</p>
          <p>Yet wherefore blame I Love ? the blame is mine; <br>
            I, wretched I, first taught her to design! <br>
            I first instructed her her spies to foil; <br>
            Back on myself my wanton arts receil : <br>
            Herbs of rare energy my skill supplied, <br>
            All marks of too-fond gallantry to hide ! <br>
            More artful now, alone the wanton lies; <br>
            And new pretexts her cozening brains devise.</p>
          <p>Uncautious lord of a too cunning spouse ! <br>
            Admittance grant me, she shall keep her vows ! <br>
            Be warn'd, my friend, observe her when her tongue <br>
            Commends in wanton phrase the gay-dress'd young; <br>
            Oh let her not her heaving bosom bare, <br>
            Exposed to every fop's immodest stare. <br>
            When leaning on the board, with flowing wine, <br>
            She seems to draw some inconsiderate line ; <br>
            Take heed, take heed, (I know the warning true,) <br>
            These random lines assign an interview. <br>
            Nor let your wife to fanes so frequent roam, <br>
            A modest wife's best temple is at home: <br>
            But if your prohibitions all are vain, <br>

            I'll bring her wanton privacies to light.</p>
          <p>Some gem she wore, I'd oft pretend to view <br>
            But squeez'd her fingers unperceiv'd of you: <br>

            Oft with full racy bowls I seal'd your eyes, <br>
            Water my bev'rage, and obtain'd the prize. <br>
            Yet since I tell, forgive the pranks I play'd, <br>
            Love prompted all, and Love must be obey'd!</p>
          <p>Nay, 'twas at me (be now the truth avow'd) <br>
            Your watchful mastiff used to bark so loud; <br>
            But now some other, with insidious wait, <br>
            Intent observes each creaking of your gate, <br>
            At which, whoever of the house appears, <br>
            Passing, the mien of quick despatch he wears; <br>
            But comes again the minute they remove, <br>
            And coughs, sure signal of impatient love !</p>
          <p>What boots, though marriage gave a wife so fair, <br>
            If careless you, or she eludes your care ? <br>
            While men are artful, and your wife can feign, <br>
            Vain are your brazen bolts, your mastiffs vain.</p>
          <p>Cold to the raptures of the genial bed, <br>
            She lays the fault upon an aching head: <br>
            'Tis false; the wanton for some other sighs; <br>
            From this her coolness, this her aches arise.</p>
          <p>Then, then be warn'd, intrust her to my care; <br>
            Whips, chains I laugh at, if you grant my prayer. <br>

            Illegal love oft springs from essenced clothes." <br>
            Where’er she walks, not distant I'll attend, <br>
            And guard your honour from the casual friend ! <br>
            " Off, gallants, off: for so the gods ordain, <br>
            So the dread priestess in unerring strain !” <br>
            (When holy fury fires the frantic dame, <br>
            She mocks all torture, and exults in flame; <br>
            Her snow-white arms and heaving breast she tears ; <br>
            And with the gushing gore Bellona smears ; <br>
            Deep in her side she plants the glittering sword; <br>
            And the dread goddess prompts each fateful word.) <br>

            Their wealth shall perish, and their manhood die."</p>
          <p>She menaced then the fair with dreadful pain ; <br>

            Oft me conducted to the blooming maid ; <br>
            My footsteps, wakeful, from afar she knew. <br>
            Unbarr'd the gate, nor fear'd the nightly dew: <br>
            Half of my life's long thread I'd pleas'd resign, <br>
            My sweet conductress, could I lengthen thine! <br>
            Still, still, though much abus'd, I Delia prize ; <br>
            She's still thy daughter, and enchants my eyes.</p>
          <p>Yet though no coy cimarr invest the fair, <br>
            Nor vestal fillet bind her auburn hair ; <br>
            Teach her what decent modesty requires, <br>
            To crown my fire, alone, with equal fires. <br>
            Me too confine; and if, in wanton praise <br>
            Of other maids, my tongue luxuriant strays, <br>
            Let thy suspicion then no limits know, <br>
            Insult me, spurn me, as thy greatest foe! <br>
            But if your jealousies are built in air, <br>
            And patient love your usage cannot bear; <br>
            What wrath may perpetrate, my soul alarms, <br>

            Nor yet be chaste from mean unamorous fear; <br>
            Be still most modest when I am not near.</p>
          <p>For those, whom neither wit nor worth secure, <br>
            Grow old, unpitied ; palsied, worthless, poor ; <br>

            Subdue their wildness, and mature the year: <br>

          <p>IN vain would lovers hide their infant-smart <br>
            From me, a master in the amorous art; <br>
            I read their passion in their mien and eyes, <br>
            Overhear their whispers, and explain their sighs. <br>
            This skill no Delphian oracles bestow'd, <br>
            No augurs taught me, and no victims showed; <br>
            But Love my wrists with magic fillets bound, <br>
            Lash'd me, and lashing, muttered many a sound. <br>
            No more then, Maratlius, indifference feign, <br>
            Else vengeful Venus will enhance your pain !</p>
          <p>What now, sweet youth, avails your anxious care, <br>
            So oft to essence, oft to change your hair ? <br>
            What though cosmetics all their aid supply, <br>
            And every artifice of dress you try ? <br>
            She's not obliged to bredes, to gems, to clothes, <br>
            Her charms to nature Pholoe only owes.</p>
          <p>What spells devote you ? say, what philtres bind ? <br>
            What midnight sorceress fascinates your mind ? <br>
            Spells can seduce the corn from neighbouring plains ! <br>
            The headlong serpent halts at magic strains ! <br>
            And did not cymbals stop thy prone career, <br>
            A spell thee, Luna, from thy orb would tear!</p>
          <p>Why do I magic for your passion blame, <br>
            Magic is useless to a perfect frame ! <br>
            You squeezed her hands, your arms around her threw, <br>
            Joined lip to lip, and hence your passion grew.</p>
          <p>Cease then, fair maid, to give your lover pain <br>
            Love hates the haughty, will avenge the swain. <br>
            See youth vermilions o'er his modest face ! <br>
            Can riches equal such a boy's embrace ? <br>
            Then ask no bribe-when age affects the gay, <br>
            Your every smile let hoary dotage pay; <br>
             <pb n="335"/>
            But you your arms around the stripling throw, <br>
            And scorn the treasure monarchs can bestow. <br>
            But she who gives to age her charms for pay, <br>
            May her wealth perish and her bloom decay. <br>
            Then when impatience thrills in every vein, <br>
            May manhood shun her, and the young disdain.</p>
          <p>Alas ! when age has silver'd o'er the head, <br>
            And youth that feeds the lamp of love isfled, <br>
            In vain the toilette charms ; 'tis vain to try, <br>
            Grey scanty locks with yellow nuts to die ; <br>
            You strip the tell-tales vainly from their place, <br>
            And vainly strive to mend an aged face.</p>
          <p>Then in thine eyes while youth triumphant glows, <br>
            And with his flowers thy cheeks, my fair one, sows, <br>
            Incline thine heart to love and gentle play, <br>
            Youth, youth has rapid wings, and flies away! <br>
            The fond old lover vilify, disdain ; <br>
            What praise can crown you from a stripling's pain ? <br>
            Spare then the lovely boy ; his beauties die, <br>
            By no dire sickness sent him from the sky : <br>
            The gods are just; you, Pholoe, are to blame ; <br>
            His sallow colour from your coyness came.</p>
          <p>Oh, wretched youth ! how oft, when absent you, <br>
            Groans rend his breast, and tears his cheeks bedew! <br>
            “Why dost thou rack me with contempt?" he cries, <br>
            " The willing ever can elude their spies. <br>
            Had you, oh had you felt what now I feel, <br>
            Venus would teach you from your spies to steal. <br>
            I can breathe low ; can snatch the melting kiss, <br>

            Poor fruitless skill ! my skill if she despise, <br>
            And cruel from the bed of rapture flies. <br>
            Or if a promise haply I obtain, <br>
            That she will recompense at night my pain ; <br>
            How am I duped ! I wakeful listen round, <br>
            And think I hear her in each casual sound. <br>

            No more complain, for oh ! she stops her ears. <br>
            The gods, I warn you, hate the haughty fair, <br>
            Reject their incense, and deny their prayer. <br>
            This youth, this Marathus, who wears your chains, <br>
            Late laugh'd at love, and ridiculed its pains ! <br>
            Th' impatient lover in the street would stay! <br>
            Nor dreamt that vengeance would his crimes repay. <br>
            Now, now he moans his past misdeeds with tears, <br>
            A prey to love, and all its frantic fears: <br>
            Now he exclaims at female scorn and hate ; <br>
            And from his soul abhors a bolted gate !</p>
          <p>Like vengeance waits you, trust th' unerring Muse, <br>

          <p>WHY did you swear by all the powers above, <br>
            Yet never meant to crown my longing love ? <br>
            Wretch, though at first the perjured deed you hide, <br>

            By stars, the sailor steers his watery way. <br>
            Yet, gracious gods, this gold from man remove, <br>

            The wretch will rack, who sells her charms for gain. <br>
            Let torture all her cruelties exert, <br>

            With sleep or wine o'ercome, so fate ordains, <br>
            You'll blab the secret of your impious gains."</p>
          <p>Thus oft I warn'd you ; this augments my shame; <br>

            “Be mine the bard," you sigh'd, " I crave no more: <br>
            Not all Campania shall my heart entice, <br>
            For thee Campania's autumns I despise. <br>
            Let Bacchus in Falernian vineyards stray, <br>
            Not Bacchus' vineyards shall my faith betray."</p>
          <p>Such strong professions, in so soft a strain, <br>
            Might well deceive a captivated swain ; <br>
            Such strong professions might aversion charm, <br>
            Slow doubt determine, and indifference warm. <br>
            Nay more, you wept, unpractised to betray, <br>
            I kiss'd your cheeks, and wiped the tears away.</p>
          <p>But if I tempting gold unjustly blame, <br>

            By each adulterer be your wife enjoy'd. <br>

            To him she prostitutes, unawed by shame, <br>
            Your house, your pocket, and your injured fame: <br>

          <p>WHO was the first that forged the deadly blade ? <br>
            Of rugged steel his savage soul was made; <br>
            By him, his bloody flag ambition waved, <br>
            And grisly carnage through the battle raved. <br>
            Yet wherefore blame him ? we're ourselves to blame; <br>
            Arms first were forged to kill the savage game: <br>
            Death-dealing battles were unknown of old; <br>
            Death-dealing battles took their rise from gold. <br>
            When beechen bowls on oaken tables stood, <br>

            But now I'm dragg'd to war, perhaps my foe <br>
            E'en now prepares th' inevitable blow !</p>
          <p>Come then, paternal gods, whose help I 've known <br>

            Nor foreign incense on your altars blazed, <br>

            And first gay-laughing prest the ruddy wine; <br>
            The father quaffs, deep quaff his joyous friends, <br>
            Yet to his son a well-stored vault descends.</p>
          <p>Bright shine the ploughshare, our support and joy ! <br>
            But rust, deep rust, the veteran's arms destroy !</p>
          <p>The villager, (his sacred offerings paid <br>
            In the dark grove and consecrated shade,) <br>
            His wife and sons, now darkness parts the throng, <br>
            Drives home, and whistles as he reels along. <br>
            Then triumphs Venus ; then love-feuds prevail; <br>
            The youth all jealous then the fair assail; <br>
            Doors, windows fly, no deference they pay, <br>
            The chastest suffer in th' ungentle fray: <br>
            These beat their breasts and melt in moving tears; <br>
            The lover weeps and blames his rage and fears; <br>
             <pb n="341"/>
            Love sits between, unmoved with tears and sighs, <br>
            And with incentives sly the feud supplies.</p>
          <p>Ye youths, though stung with taunts, of blows beware <br>
            They, they are impious, who can beat the fair: <br>
            If much provoked, or rend their silken zone, <br>
            Or on their tresses be your anger shown: <br>
            But if nor this your passion can appease, <br>
            Until the charmer weep, the charmer tease ! <br>
            Blest anger, if the fair dissolves in tears! <br>
            Blest youth, her fondness undisguised appears ! <br>
            But crush the wretch, 0 war, with all thy woes, <br>
            Who to rough usage adds the crime of blows.</p>
          <p>Bland Peace, descend with plenty on our plains, <br>
            And bless with ease and laughing sport the swains. <br>

          <p>ATTEND ! and favour ! as our sires ordain, <br>
            The fields we lustrate, and the rising grain: <br>
            Come, Bacchus, and thy horns with grapes surround ; <br>
            Come, Ceres, with thy wheaten garland crown'd ; <br>
            This hallow'd day suspend each swain his toil, <br>
            Rest let the plough, and rest th' uncultured soil: <br>
            Unyoke the steer, his racks heap high with hay, <br>
            And deck with wreaths his honest front to-day. <br>
            Be all your thoughts to this grand work applied! <br>
            And lay, ye thrifty fair, your wool aside ! <br>
            Hence I command you mortals from the rite, <br>
            Who spent in amorous blandishment the night, <br>
            The vernal powers in chastity delight. <br>
            But come, ye pure, in spotless garbs array'd! <br>
            For you the solemn festival is made; <br>

            To-day we purge the farmer and the field; <br>
            Oh let no weeds destroy the rising grain ; <br>
            By no fell prowler be the lambkin slain ; <br>
            So shall the hind dread penury no more, <br>
            But gaily smiling o'er his plenteous store, <br>
            With liberal hand shall larger billets bring, <br>
            Heap the broad hearth, and hail the genial spring. <br>
            His numerous bond-slaves all in goodly rows, <br>
            With wicker huts your altars shall enclose. <br>
            That done, they'll cheerly laugh, and dance, and play, <br>

          <p>The gods assent! see ! see ! those entrails show <br>

            Health to Messala, every peasant toast, <br>
            And not a letter of his name be lost!</p>
          <p>O come, my friend, whom Gallic triumphs grace, <br>
            Thou noblest splendour of an ancient race; <br>
            Thou whom the arts all emulously crown, <br>
            Sword of the state, and honour of the gown; <br>
            My theme is gratitude, inspire my lays ! <br>
            Oh be my Genius ! while I strive to praise <br>
            The rural deities, the rural plain, <br>
            The use of foodful corn they taught the swain. <br>
            They taught man first the social hut to raise, <br>
            And thatch it o'er with turf, or leafy sprays: <br>
            They first to tame the furious bull essay'd, <br>
            And on rude wheels the rolling carriage laid. <br>
            Man left his savage ways; the garden glow'd, <br>
            Fruits not their own admiring trees bestow'd, <br>
            While through the thirsty ground meandering runnels <br>
            flow'd. <br>
            There bees uf sweets despoil the breathing spring, <br>
            And to their cells the dulcet plunder bring. <br>
             <pb n="343"/>
            The ploughman first to soothe the toilsome day, <br>
            Chanted in measured feet his sylvan lay: <br>
            And, seed-time o'er, he first in blithesome vein. <br>
            Piped to his household gods the hymning strain. <br>
            Then first the press with purple wine overran, <br>
            And cooling water made it fit for man. <br>
            The village lad first made a wreath of flowers <br>
            To deck in spring the tutelary powers: <br>
            Blest be the country, yearly there the plain <br>
            Yields, when the dog-star burns, the golden grain ; <br>
            Thence too thy chorus, Bacchus, first began, <br>
            The painted clown first laid the tragic plan. <br>
            A goat, the leader of the shaggy throng, <br>
            The village sent it, recompensed the song. <br>
            There too the sheep his woolly treasure wears; <br>
            There too the swain his woolly treasure shears; <br>
            This to the thirsty dame long work supplies; <br>
            The distaff hence, and basket took their rise. <br>
            Hence too the various labours of the loom, <br>
            Thy praise, Minerva, and Arachne's doom ! <br>
            Mid mountain herds Love first drew vital air, <br>
            Unknown to man, and man had nought to fear ; <br>
            'Gainst herds, his bow th' unskilful archer drew ; <br>
            Ah my pierced heart, an archer now too true ! <br>
            Now herds may roam untouched, 'tis Cupid's joy, <br>
            The brave to vanquish, and to fix the coy. <br>
            The youth whose heart the soft emotion feels, <br>
            Nor sighs for wealth, nor waits at grandeur's heels ; <br>
            Age fired by Love is touch'd by shame no more, <br>
            But blabs its follies at the fair one's door! <br>
            Led by soft Love, the tender, trembling fair <br>
            Steals to her swain, and cheats suspicion's care, <br>
            With outstretched arms she wins her darkling way. <br>
            And tiptoe listens that no noise betray !</p>
          <p>Ah wretched those on whom dread Cupid frowns! <br>
            How happy they whose mutual choice lie crowns ! <br>
            Will Love partake the banquet of the day ? <br>
            O come-but throw thy burning shafts away.</p>
          <p>Ye swains, begin to mighty Love the song, <br>
            Your songs, ye swains, to mighty Love belong ! <br>

            Breathe out aloud your wishes for my fold, <br>
            Your own soft vows in whispers may be told. <br>
            But hark ! loud mirth and music fire the crowd— <br>
            Ye now may venture to request aloud !</p>
          <p>Pursue your sports ; night mounts her curtain'd wain <br>
            The dancing stars compose her filial train; <br>
            Black muffled sleep steals on with silent pace, <br>

            Not venal, you request no Eastern stores, <br>
            Where ruddy waters lave the gemmy shores : <br>
            Your wish I guess; you wish a beauteous spouse, <br>
            Joy of your joy, and faithful to your vows. <br>
            'Tis done ! my friend ! see nuptial Love appears ! <br>

            A yellow zone, that spite of years shall last, <br>
            And heighten fondness, e'en when beauty's past.</p>
          <p>With happy signs, great power, confirm our prayer <br>
            With endless concord bless the married pair. <br>

          <p>My fair, Cornutus, to the country's flown, <br>
            Oh how insipid is the city grown ! <br>
            No taste have they for elegance refined, <br>
            No tender blossoms, who remain behind : <br>
            Now Cytherea glads the laughing plain, <br>
            And smiles and sports compose her sylvan train. <br>
            Now Cupid joys to learn the ploughman's phrase, <br>
            And clad a peasant, o'er the fallows strays. <br>
            Oh how the weighty prong I'll busy wield ! <br>
            Should the fair wander to the labour'd field ; <br>
            A farmer then, the crooked ploughshare hold, <br>
            Whilst the dull ox prepares the vigorous mould: <br>
            I'd not complain though Phœbus burnt the lands, <br>
            And painful blisters swell'd my tender hands.</p>
          <p>Admetus' herds the fair Apollo drove, <br>
            In spite of med'cine's power, a prey to love ; <br>
            Nor aught avail'd to soothe his amorous care, <br>
            His lyre of silver sound, or waving hair. <br>
            To quench their thirst the kine to streams he led, <br>
            And drove them from their pasture to the shed: <br>
            The milk to curdle, then, the fair he taught, <br>
            And from the cheese to strain the dulcet draught. <br>
            Oft, oft his virgin sister blush'd for shame, <br>
            As bearing lambkins o'er the field he came ! <br>
            Oft would he sing the list'ning vales among, <br>
            Till lowing oxen broke the plaintive song. <br>
            To Delphi trembling, anxious chiefs repair, <br>
            But got no answer, Phœbus was not there. <br>
            Thy curling locks that charm'd a step-dame's eye, <br>
            A jealous step-dame now neglected fly! <br>
            To see thee, Phœbus, thus disfigured stray, <br>
            Who could discover the fair god of day ? <br>
            Constrained by Cupid in a cot to <unclear>pine</unclear>, <br>
            Where was thy Delos, where thy Pythian shrine ? <br>
             <pb n="346"/>
            Thrice happy days, when Love almighty sway'd! <br>
            And openly the gods his will obey'd. <br>
            Now Love's soft power's become a common jest- <br>
            Yet those who feel his influence in their breast, <br>
            The prude's contempt, the wise man's sneer despise, <br>
            Nor would his chains forego to rule the skies.</p>
          <p>Curst farm ! that forced my Nemesis from town, <br>
            Blasts taint thy vines, and rains thy harvests drown. <br>
            Though hymns implore your aid, great god of wine! <br>
            Assist the lover, and neglect the vine; <br>
            To shades, unpunish'd, ne'er let beauty stray ; <br>
            Not all your vintage can its absence pay! <br>
            Rather than harvest should the fair detain, <br>
            May rills and acorns feed th' unactive swain ! <br>
            The swains of old no golden Ceres knew, <br>
            And yet how fervent was their love and true ! <br>
            Their melting vows the Paphian queen approved, <br>
            And every valley witness'd how they loved. <br>
            Then lurk'd no spies to catch the willing maid; <br>
            Doorless each house; in vain no shepherd pray'd. <br>
            Once more, ye simple usages, obtain ! <br>
            No-lead me, drive me to the cultur'd plain ! <br>
            Enchain me, whip me, if the fair command ; <br>

            By thee compell'd I rob the hallow'd shrine, <br>

          <p>I SEE my slavery, and a mistress near; <br>
            Oh, freedom of my fathers ! fare thee well ! <br>
            A slavery wretched, and a chain severe, <br>
            Nor Love remits the bonds that o'er me fell.</p>
          <p>How have I then deserved consuming pain ? <br>
            Or for what sin am I of flames the prey ? <br>

            Bitter the day, and all! the nightly shade; <br>
            And all my hours in venom'd stream have roll'd ; <br>
            No elegies, no lays of Phœbus, aid; <br>
            With hollow palm she craves the tinkling gold.</p>
          <p>Away, ye Muses ! if ye serve not Love : <br>
            I, not to sing of battles, woo your strain ; <br>
            How walks the bright-hair'd sun the heavens above, <br>
            Or turns the full-orb'd moon her steeds again.</p>
          <p>By verse I seek soft access to my fair; <br>
            Away, ye Muses ! with the useless lore ; <br>
            Through blood and pillage I must gifts prepare; <br>
            Or weep, thrown prostrate at her bolted door.</p>
          <p>Suspended spoils I'll snatch from pompous fanes ; <br>
            But Venus first shall violated be ; <br>
            She prompts the sacrilege, who forged the chains; <br>
            And gave that nymph insatiable to me.</p>
          <p>Perish the wretch ! who culls the emerald green, <br>
            Or paints the snowy fleece with Tyrian red ! <br>
            Through filmy Coan robes her limbs are seen, <br>
            And India's pearls gleam lucid from her head.</p>
          <p>'Tis pamper'd avarice thus corrupts the fair; <br>
            The key is turn'd ; the mastiff guards the door : <br>
            The guard's disarm'd, if large the bribe you bear; <br>

          <p>For thee, that shutt'st the lover from thy door, <br>

            None pay the mournful tribute to thy grave.</p>
          <p>But she, unbribed, unbought, yet melting kind, <br>
            May she a hundred years, unfading, bloom ; <br>
             <pb n="350"/>
            Be wept, while on the flaming pile reclined, <br>
            And yearly garlands twine her pillar'd tomb.</p>

            Honouring the raptures that his youth had blest, <br>
            Shall hang the wreath, and slow-departing say, <br>
            " Sleep !-and may earth lie light upon thy breast !”</p>
          <p>Truth prompts my tongue ; but what can truth avail ? <br>
            The love her laws prescribe must now be mine ; <br>
            My ancestors' loved groves I set to sale- <br>
            My household gods, your title I resign !</p>
          <p>Nay—Circe's juice, Medea's drugs, each plant <br>
            Of Thessaly, whence dews of poison fall ;- <br>

            That with thy golden lyre thou stand'st contest: <br>
            Deign, mighty bard ! to strike the vocal string, <br>

            The Sibyl-leaves if Rome ne'er sought in vain, <br>

            And all the triumphs of the Roman state ; <br>
            Yet when he saw his Ilion wrapp'd in flame, <br>

          <p>(Quirinus had not plann'd eternal Rome, <br>

            Sprinkled with milk, Pan graced an oak's dun shade, <br>

            And where the west shuts up the gates of day. <br>
            The truth I sing; so may the laurels prove <br>
            Safe food, and I be screen'd from guilty love."</p>
          <p>Thus sung the sibyl, and addressed her prayer, <br>

            Nor, Phoebus ! give him only these to know, <br>
            A further knowledge on thy priest bestow: <br>
            Let him interpret what thy fav'rite maid, <br>
            What Amalthea, what Mermessia said : <br>
            Let him interpret what Albuna bore <br>
            Through Tiber's waves, unwet, to Tiber's farthest shore.</p>
          <p>When stony tempests fell, when comets glared, <br>
            Intestine wars their oracles declared: <br>
            The sacred groves (our ancestors relate) <br>
            Foretold the changes of the Roman state: <br>
            To charge the clarion sounded in the sky, <br>
            Arms clash'd, blood ran, and warriors seem'd to die: <br>
            With monstrous prodigies the year began ; <br>
            An annual darkness the whole globe o'erran ; <br>
            Apollo, shorn of every beamy ray, <br>
            Oft strove, but strove in vain, to light the day: <br>
            The statues of the gods wept tepid tears; <br>
            And speaking oxen fill'd mankind with fears !</p>
          <p>These were of old : no more, Apollo ! frown, <br>
            But in the waves each adverse omen drown. <br>
            Oh ! let thy bays in crackling flames ascend, <br>
            So shall the year with joy begin and end ! <br>
            The bays give prosperous signs ; rejoice, ye swains ! <br>
            Propitious Ceres shall reward your pains. <br>
            With must the jolly rustic purpled o'er, <br>

            Now, fired with wine, they solemn bonfires raise, <br>
            And leap, untimorous, through the strawy blaze! <br>
            From every cot unnumbered children throng, <br>
            Frequent the dance, and louder raise the song: <br>
            And while in mirth the hours they thus employ, <br>
            At home the grandsire tends his little boy; <br>
            And in each feature pleased himself to trace, <br>
            Foretells his prattler will adorn the race.</p>
          <p>The sylvan youth, their grateful homage paid, <br>
            Where plays some streamlet, seek th' embowering shade; <br>
            Or stretched on soft enamel'd meadows lie, <br>
            Where thickest umbrage cools the summer sky: <br>
            With roses, see ! the sacred cup is crown'd, <br>
            Hark ! music breathes her animating sound : <br>
            The couch of turf, and festal tables stand <br>

            And all well-pleased the votive feast prepare, <br>
            Each one his goblet and each one his share. <br>
            Now drunk, they blame their stars and curse the maid, <br>
            But sober, deprecate whatever they said.</p>
          <p>Perish thy shafts, Apollo ! and thy bow ! <br>
            If Love unarmed in our forests go. <br>
            Yet since he learned to wing th' unerring dart, <br>
            Much cause has man to curse his fatal art: <br>
            But most have I; the sun has wheel'd his round <br>
            Since first I felt the deadly festering wound ; <br>
            Yet, yet I fondly, madly, wish to burn, <br>
            Abjure indifference, and at comfort spurn ; <br>
            And though from Nemesis my Genius flows, <br>
            Her scarce I sing, so weighty are my woes !</p>
          <p>O cruel Love ! how joyous should I be, <br>
            Your arrows broke and torch extinct to see! <br>
            From you, my want of reverence to the skies! <br>
            From you, my woes and imprecations rise ! <br>

            Her lover's heart is least Neæra's care, <br>
            And I through war must seek detested gold, <br>
            Not for myself, but for my venal fair :</p>
          <p>That while she bends beneath the weight of dress, <br>
            The stiffen'd robe may spoil her easy mien : <br>
            And art mistaken make her beauty less, <br>
            While still it hides some graces better seen.</p>
          <p>But if such toys can win her lovely smile, <br>

          <p>THOUSANDS in death would seek an end of woe, <br>
            But hope, deceitful hope ! prevents the blow ! <br>
            Hope plants the forest, and she sows the plain, <br>
            And feeds with future granaries the swain ; <br>
            Hope snares the winged vagrants of the sky, <br>
            Hope cheats in reedy brooks the scaly fry; <br>
            By hope the fetter'd slave, the drudge of fate, <br>
            Sings, shakes his irons, and forgets his state; <br>
            Hope promised you, you haughty still deny; <br>
            Yield to the goddess, 0 my fair ! comply. <br>
            Hope whisper'd me, " Give sorrow to the wind! <br>
            The haughty fair one shall at last be kind." <br>
            Yet, yet you treat me with the same disdain: <br>
            O let not hope's soft whispers prove in vain !</p>
          <p>Untimely fate your sister snatch'd away; <br>
            Spare me, 0 spare me, by her shade I pray! <br>
            So shall my garlands deck her virgin-tomb ; <br>
            So shall I weep, no hypocrite, her doom! <br>
            So may her grave with rising flowers be drest, <br>
            And the green turf lie lightly on her breast.</p><pb n="357"/>
            
          <p>Ah me! will nought avail ? the world I'll fly, <br>
            And, prostrate at her tomb, a suppliant sigh ! <br>
            To her attentive ghost, of you complain ; <br>
            Tell my long sorrowing, tell of your disdain. <br>
            Oft, when alive, in my behalf she spoke: <br>
            Your endless coyness must her shade provoke: <br>
            With ugly dreams she'll haunt your hour of rest, <br>
            And weep before you, an unwelcome guest! <br>
            Ghastly and pale as when besmeared with blood, <br>
            Oh fatal fall! she pass'd the Stygian flood.</p>
          <p>No more, my strains ! your eyes with tears o'erflow, <br>
            This moving object renovates your woe: <br>
            You, you are guiltless ! I your maid accuse ; <br>
            You generous are ! she, she has selfish views. <br>
            Nay, were you guilty, I'll no more complain ; <br>
            One tear from you overpays a life of pain ! <br>
            She, Phryne, promised to promote my vows: <br>
            She took, but never gave my billet-doux. <br>
            You're gone abroad, she confidently swears, <br>
            Oft when your sweet-toned voice salutes mine care : <br>
            Or, when you promise to reward my pains, <br>
            That you're afraid, or indisposed, she feigns: <br>
            Then madding jealousy inflames my breast; <br>
            Then fancy represents a rival blest; <br>
            I wish thee, Phryne ! then, a thousand woes ;- <br>
            And if the gods with half my wishes close, <br>
            Phryne ! a wretch of wretches thou shalt be, <br>
            And vainly beg of death to set thee free ! GRANGER.</p>

          <p>MANY by death their fatal ills would end, <br>
            Credulous hope does still their reign extend, <br>
            And promise wonders from the following day; <br>
            To-morrow's sun shines always bright and gay. <br>
            Hope feeds the husbandman, and soothes his toil; <br>
            Hope lends the seed-corn to the furrow'd soil. <br>
            That with a large increase the fertile field <br>
            May to his thirsty wishes golden harvests yield: <br>
            This to the snare the heedless birds betrays, <br>
            This to the hidden hook the finny race. <br>

            The galley-slave, bound fast in solid gyves, <br>
            From this a comfort in his woes derives ; <br>
            Who, whilst his legs resound with clinking chains, <br>
            Tugs at the oar and sings amidst his pains. <br>
            Hope shows me Nemesis all soft and kind, <br>
            But still averse the froward nymph I find. <br>
            Let not the goddess of thy name appear, <br>
            Ah ! cruel maid ! less fierce and less severe, <br>
            Ah ! spare my anguish and thy hate abate, <br>
            I be- this for thy sister's timeless fate. <br>
            Disturb not with thy cruelty her grave, <br>
            But with a speedy smile thy votary save. <br>
            She is my saint, I to her tomb will bear <br>
            My gifts and chaplets wet with many a tear; <br>
            Yes, to her tomb I'll fly, her suppliant prove, <br>
            And with her silent urn deplore my love: <br>
            She will not leave her client to his pain, <br>
            Nor let his tears for thee be ever vain. <br>
            I charge thee therefore in her name to prove <br>
            More swiftly kind to my complaining love. <br>
            Lest her neglected manes in the night <br>
            Thy conscious slumbers with sad dreams affright; <br>
            And stand before thee all besmear'd with blood, <br>
            As she fell downward to the Stygian flood. <br>
            But hold-that dismal story I'll forbear, <br>
            Lest I renew my fair one's anxious care; <br>
            I am not so much worth to call from her one tear, <br>
            Nor is it fit that tears should e'er disguise <br>
            The lustre of those dear loquacious eyes. <br>
            The bawd's my foe, and makes my vows all vain; <br>
            The tender maid would pity else my pain: <br>
            Phryne the bawd against me bars the door, <br>
            A bawd is still obdurate to the poor. <br>
            Within her secret bosom she conveys <br>
            The amorous billets for the man that pays. <br>
            Oft when the pleasing music of her voice <br>
            Alarms my heart with the approaching joys, <br>
            Though to the door the well-known accents come, <br>
            This cursed bawd will swear she's not at home. <br>
            And often when my soul is all on fire, <br>
            Summon'd by love, and swelling with desire, <br>
             <pb n="359"/>
            E'en in the harbour all my joys are split, <br>
            The eager lover Phryne won't admit; <br>
            But with dissembled terror in her air, <br>
            Pretends that sudden pangs have seized my fair; <br>
            Or that some threatened danger must that night <br>
            Prorogue the promised moments of delight. <br>
            Oh ! then my wounded soul in cares expires, <br>
            And feels new anguish from my jealous fires: <br>
            My pregnant fancy soon begets alarms, <br>
            And paints some happy lover in her arms; <br>
            Paints all the tumults of the ravish'd pair, <br>
            And all the several ways he grasps the fair. <br>
            Then fall my curses on thy destin'd head, <br>
            Detested Phryne ! better thou wert dead, <br>
            Than that the gods but one of them should hear; <br>
            For all the racks that the most guilty fear, <br>
            Would be thy hated lot, thy cursed share. OTWAY.</p>

          <p>LAST night's ill-boding dreams, ye gods, avert! <br>
            Nor plague, with portents, a poor lover's heart! <br>
            But why? From prejudice our terrors rise; <br>
            Vain visions have no commerce with the skies: <br>
            Th' event of things the gods alone foresee, <br>
            And Tuscan priests foretell what they decree. <br>
            Dreams flit at midnight round the lover's head, <br>
            And timorous man alarm with idle dread: <br>
            And hence oblations to divert the woe, <br>
            Weak, superstitious minds on heaven bestow. <br>
            But since whate'er the gods foretell is true, <br>
            And man's oft warn'd, mysterious dreams ! by you; <br>
            Dread Juno! make my nightly visions vain, <br>
            Vain make my boding fears, and calm my pain ! <br>
            The blessed gods, you know, I ne'er reviled, <br>
            And nought iniquous e'er my heart defiled.</p>
          <p>Now night had laved her coursers in the main, <br>
            And left to dewy dawn a doubtful reign ; <br>
            Bland sleep, that from the couch of sorrow flies, <br>
            (The wretch's solace,) had not closed my eyes <br>
            At last, when morn unbarr'd the gates of light, <br>
            A downv slumber shut my labouring sight: <br>
            A youth appear'd, with virgin laurel crown'd, <br>
            He moved majestic, and I heard the sound. <br>
             <pb n="366"/>
            Such charms, such manly charms, were never seen, <br>
            As fired his eyes, and harmonized his mien ; <br>
            His hair, in ringlets of an auburn hue, <br>
            Shed Syrian sweets, and o'er his shoulders flew <br>
            As white as thine, fair Luna ! was his skin, <br>
            So vein'd with azure, and as smoothly thin ; <br>
            So soft a blush vermilion'd o'er his face, <br>
            As when a maid first melts in man's embrace; <br>
            Or when the fair with curious art unite <br>
            The purple amaranth and lily white. <br>
            A bloom like his, when tinged by autumn's pride, <br>
            Reddens the apple on the sunny side; <br>
            A Tyrian tunic to his andes flow'd, [show'd <br>
            Which through its sidled plaits his godlike beautify <br>
            A lyre, the present mulciber, bestow'd, <br>
            On his left arm with easy grandeur glow'd; <br>
            The peerless work of virgin gold was made <br>
            With ivory, gems, and tortoise interlaid; <br>
            O'er all the vocal strings his fingers stray, <br>
            The vocal strings his fingers glad obey, <br>
            And, harmonized, a sprightly prelude play: <br>
            But when he join'd the music of his tongue, <br>
            These soft, sad elegiac lays he sung :</p>
          <p>" All hail, thou care of heaven ! (a virtuous bard, <br>
            The god of wine, the Muses, I regard;) <br>
            But neither Bacchus nor the Thespian Nine, <br>
            The sacred will of destiny divine: <br>
            The secret book of destiny to see, <br>
            Heaven's awful sire has given alone to me; <br>
            And I, unerring god, to you explain <br>
            (Attend and credit) what the Fates ordain.</p>
          <p>" She who is still your ever-constant care, <br>
            Dearer to you than sons to mothers are, <br>
            Whose beauties bloom in every soften'd line, <br>
            Her sex's envy, and the love of thine: <br>
            Not with more warmth is female fondness moved. <br>
            Not with more warmth are tenderest brides beloved. <br>
            For whom you hourly importune the sky, <br>
            For whom you wish to live, nor fear to die, <br>
             <pb n="367"/>
            Whose form, when night has wrapt in black the pole, <br>
            Cheats in soft vision your enamour'd soul; <br>
            Neæra! whose bright charms your verse displays, <br>
            Seeks a new lover, and inconstant strays ! <br>
            For thee no more with mutual warmth she burns, <br>
            But thy chaste house and chaste embrace she spurns.</p>
          <p>" Oh cruel, perjured, false, intriguing sex ! <br>
            Oh born with woes poor wretched man to vex! <br>
            Whoe'er has learn'd her lover to betray, <br>
            Her beauty perish, and her name decay !</p>
          <p>" Yet, as the sex will change, avoid despair ; <br>
            A patient homage may subdue the fair. <br>
            Fierce Love taught man to suffer, laugh at pain ; <br>
            Fierce Love taught man, with joy, to drag the chain , <br>
            Fierce Love, nor vainly fabulous the tale, <br>
            Forced me, yes, forced me, to the lonely dale: <br>
            There I Admetus' snowy heifers drove, <br>
            Nor tuned my lyre, nor sung, absorb'd in love. <br>
            The favourite son of heaven's almighty sire, <br>
            Preferr'd a straw-pipe to his golden lyre.</p>
          <p>" Though false the fair, though Love is wild, obey, <br>
            Or, youth, you know not Love's tyrannic sway. <br>
            In plaintive strains address the haughty fair; <br>
            The haughty soften at the voice of prayer. <br>
            If ever true my Delphian answers prove, <br>
            Bear this my message to the maid you love.</p>
          <p>" Pride of your sex, and passion of the age ! <br>
            No more let other men your love engage ; <br>
            A bard on you the Delian god bestows, <br>
            This match alone can warrant your repose."</p>
          <p>He sung. When Morpheus from my pillow flew, <br>
            And plunged me in substantial griefs anew.</p>
          <p>Ah ! who could think that thou hadst broke thy vo <br>

            Such horrid crimes as all mankind detest, <br>
            Could they, how could they, harbour in thy breast ? <br>
             <pb n="368"/>
            The ruthless deep, I know, was not thy sire : <br>
            Nor fierce Chimæra, belching floods of fire: <br>
            Nor didst thou from the triple monster spring, <br>
            Round whom a coil of kindred serpents cling; <br>
            Thou art not of the Libyan lion's seed, <br>
            Of barking Scylla's, nor Charybdis' breed; <br>
            Nor Afric's sands, nor Scythia gave thee birth; <br>
            But a compassionate, benignant earth. <br>
            No ! thou, my fair ! deriv'st thy noble race <br>
            From parents deck'd with every human grace.</p>
          <p>Ye gods ! avert the woes that haunt my mind, <br>

          <p>Now heaven forefend !-nor bring those dreams to light <br>
            That haunted the pale close of yesternight! <br>
            Away! far hence, ye false, vain shadows, fly ! <br>
            Hope not to win my fond credulity: <br>
            From gods alone unerring warnings come, <br>
            When seers in entrails read the future doom. <br>
            Dreams, like the cheating shades of night, we find, <br>
            Play with false fears upon the timid mind. <br>
            Such midnight omens superstition sees, <br>
            Which crackling salt and holy meal appease. <br>
            But whether truth to others shadowed seem <br>
            In the seer's warning, or the lying dream ; <br>
            At least may Luna chase these fears in air, <br>
            Which my poor heart has ill deserved to bear: <br>
            If pure my conscience from crime's deepening dye, <br>
            Nor e'er my tongue blasphemed the powers on high.</p>
          <p>Night now had measured heaven's cærulean steep <br>
            With sable steeds; her laved wheels touch'd the deep <br>
            But sleep, that soothes the wretched, soothed not me; <br>
            Still from an anxious chamber prompt to flee: <br>
            Till, when the sun peep'd faint from eastern skies, <br>
            Late slumber settled on my languid eyes. <br>
            When lo! a youth was seen my floor to tread, <br>
            Chaste laurels nodding round his wreathed head. <br>
             <pb n="369"/>
            No form so fair adorn'd the age of gold: <br>
            No form so fair could spring from human mould: <br>
            Loose o'er his tapering neck the ringlets flew, <br>
            That breathing myrtle dropp'd with Tyrian dew: <br>
            White as the moon did his complexion show, <br>
            And tinting crimson flush'd his skin of snow. <br>
            As virgin cheeks with tender blushes dyed, <br>
            When to the youth consents the yielded bride: <br>
            As girls with purple am'ranths lilies thread; <br>
            As apples pale catch autumn's streaky red. <br>
            A sweeping robe around his ankles trail'd; <br>
            His dazzling limbs the gorgeous vesture veil'd: <br>
            On his left side a harp suspended hung, <br>
            Of precious shell, with gold resplendent strung: <br>
            Soft, at his first approach, the chord he smote <br>
            With ivory quill, with sweet-breathed vocal note: <br>
            His fingers and his voice preluded clear, <br>
            Then sweet, but sad, his accents thrill'd my ear. <br>
            " Hail, care of heaven ! the bard of spotless love <br>

            For whom thy feverish days are cross'd with care; <br>
            And who, when sleep its umber'd mantle throws, <br>
            With nightly phantoms haunts thy vain repose: <br>
            She—fair Neæra-in thy verse divine, <br>

            Far other wishes heave her sinful breast, <br>

            No more my voice responsive cadence made; <br>
            But on a flimsy oat I whispered love: <br>
            E'en I, Latona's son, the son of Jove. <br>
            Ah ! youth ! thou know'st not love ! unless thou <unclear>bear</unclear> <br>

            Yet doubt not, nor despair; but soft complain : <br>

            Or lave, or spend in gentle sport your days: <br>
            Yet, 0 my friends ! whatever the Fates decree, <br>
            Joy guide your steps, and still remember me !</p>
          <p>Meantime, to deprecate the fierce disease, <br>
            And hasten glad returns of vigorous ease, <br>
            Milk, mix'd with wine, 0 promise to bestow, <br>
            And sable victims, on the gods below. <br>

          <p>MESSALA, thee I sing, although thy name, <br>
            Thy well-known merit, and thy spreading fame <br>
            Startle me, lest I feebly should repeat <br>
            A verse inferior to desert so great; <br>
            But though unequal to the theme I raise, <br>
            Yet I'll attempt at least to sing thy praise: <br>
            I, the designer of an humble verse, <br>
            Since none with justice can thy praise rehearse, <br>
            Unless he had thy language to express, <br>
            And clothe thy mighty deeds with manly dress; <br>
            A task superior to my trifling skill, <br>
            Yet take (if the performance fails) the will; <br>
            Let that suffice, nor thou the gift refuse, <br>
            The humble tribute of an humble Muse.</p>
          <p>Thus Phcebus kind received with smiling cheer <br>
            The little gift the Cretan could prefer. <br>
            Thus Icarus, by his celestial guest, <br>
            Bacchus, was far preferr'd before the rest, <br>
            As those bright signals in the heavens declare, <br>
            Fair Virgo, and the scorching Syrian star: <br>
             <pb n="376"/>
            Alcides, destined for unbounded power <br>
            Oft visited the poor Molorchus' bower. <br>
            The gods above do not mean offerings scorn. <br>
            Nor always claim the ox with gilded horn; <br>
            So may this humble verse, so small it be, <br>
            Come an accepted off'ring due to thee; <br>
            That I encouraged may, in time, repeat <br>
            A verse more worthy, and thy praise more <unclear>great</unclear>.</p>
          <p>Others, inspired with a sublimer flame, <br>
            May sing the vast creation's wondrous frame; <br>
            And how the earth is press'd with air around, <br>
            And how the circling sea confines the ground; <br>
            And how the fluid body of the air <br>
            Is moved with constant motion here and there; <br>
            And lightly wafting upwards does aspire <br>
            To join the high and pure ethereal fire; <br>
            And lastly, how different those bodies lie <br>
            Enclosed with the vast concave of the sky.</p>
          <p>But if my verse can well express thy praise, <br>
            Or (what's a desperate thought) can higher raise; <br>
            Or if it cannot to thy name be just, <br>
            But sinks below thy worth, as sure it must; <br>
            Whatever thoughts are spread in every line, <br>
            Whate'er I sing, the votive verse be thine.</p>
          <p>You, though your race illustriously are known, <br>
            Unsatisfied with honours handed down ; <br>
            Still follow glory with a steady pace, <br>
            And emulate the greatness of your race, <br>
            Thus all those merits which your fathers knew, <br>
            Your sons may see again revived in you.</p>
          <p>Nor shall an empty title hold thy fame, <br>
            But endless volumes shall record your name: <br>
            Crowds shall contend to have thy worth declared. <br>
            The orator, historian, and the bard: <br>
            But may the task at length on me be laid, <br>
            That so my name may with thy deeds be read.</p>
          <p>For who can greater cause for praises yield <br>
            Than you ? Or in the forum or the field, <br>
             <pb n="377"/>
            With equal worth you claim a just renown, <br>
            Braced in the helmet, or the peaceful gown. <br>
            The spreading laurels lie in equal scales, <br>
            And neither pendent hemisphere prevails.</p>
          <p>You, if the giddy vulgar rise to rage, <br>
            Appease their fury and their heat assuage. <br>
            Nor Pylus, nor could Ithaca contain <br>
            So great a worthy in their boasted train: <br>
            Nor Nestor, noted for his vast renown, <br>
            Nor great Ulysses of a little town ; <br>
            Though one had seen three hundred suns go round <br>
            Their annual courses, and revive the ground; <br>
            The other all the cities did explore, <br>
            Where'er the farthest sea includes the shore.</p>
          <p>He overcame the Thracians, fierce in arms, <br>
            Nor was subdued by Lotophagian charms. <br>
            He checked the one-eyed monster's fell design, <br>
            Making him drunk with Maronean wine. <br>
            Æolian gales he carried o'er the sea, <br>
            And to the Lestrygonians took his way, <br>
            Rough race! o'er whom Antiphates was king, <br>
            Where cool Artacia spreads her limpid spring. <br>
            Circe's bewitching arts by him were known; <br>
            Circe ! the powerful daughter of the Sun, <br>
            Who by her skill in magic simples knew <br>
            To change old Nature's forms to bodies new: <br>
            Then to Cimmerian eaves he took his way, <br>
            Wherever Phœbus roused the lightsome day, <br>
            Whether above the earth, or underneath the sea. <br>
            He view'd the dark Plutonian coasts below, <br>
            There saw the demi-gods and heroes go, <br>
            Mingled among the spectres to and fro. <br>
            Secure his easy vessel sail'd along, <br>
            Unstopp'd by the alluring Syren's song: <br>
            Him steering 'twixt the jaws of death his course, <br>
            Nor Scylla could affright with rapid source ; <br>
            Though dreadful and tremendously she raves, <br>
            Girt round with barking dogs beneath the waves; . <br>
            Nor could Charybdis, with tempestuous sea, <br>
            Destroy his vessel in her usual way: <br>
             <pb n="378"/>
            Nor when to heaven uprose the waves profound, <br>
            Nor when dividing they disclosed the ground: <br>
            Nor shall I pass great Jove's severe award, <br>
            Declared for Phoebus’ violated herd: <br>
            Nor how at length he fair Calypso found, <br>
            Her generous love and hospitable ground: <br>
            Nor how Phæacia was the happy isle <br>
            That closed his journey and relieved his toil.</p>
          <p>Now whether these were in the world we know, <br>
            Or fables feign them in some world below; <br>
            Let him his labour boast and hardy deed, <br>
            While you in moving eloquence exceed.</p>
          <p>In you the ready skill of war is found, <br>
            How to intrench the camp and raise the ground; <br>
            And how against the adverse host oppose, <br>
            Defensive palisadoes placed in rows, <br>
            And where to lead the ditch and ground enclose ; <br>
            And ere you pitch the camp, to choose that ground <br>
            Which does with pure refreshing springs abound. <br>
            Swift through your troops communications go, <br>
            Which are cut off before they reach the foe. <br>
            You various sports and active games devise, <br>
            To keep the troops in manly exercise.</p>
          <p>What chief like you can toss the pond'rous spear? <br>
            Or send the flying arrow through the air ? <br>
            Or throw the jav'lin with an arm so strong, <br>
            To cut the air and drive the clouds along ? <br>
            Or who direct the fiery courser's will, <br>
            Or moderate the rein with greater skill ? <br>
            Or ride th' extended race with swifter force, <br>

            And-lead the soldiers to a spreading wing ; <br>
            That either may a mutual aid dispense, <br>
            And guard each other with a joint defence.</p>
          <p>But let me not uncertain trophies raise, <br>
            For wars I sing, and wars confirm thy praise: <br>
            Witness the Illyrians taught the Roman sway, <br>
            The base Pannonian rebels to obey: <br>
            And Arupinum taken, which did yield <br>
            One born to arms, and constant in the field: <br>
            Poor and unknown, him whosoe'er had seen, <br>
            Unbroke with age, and e'en in winter green, <br>
            With less surprise would hear the story told <br>
            Of rev'rend Nestor's fame, three centuries old: <br>
            For though since first he had received his birth, <br>
            A hundred annual suns had warm'd the earth; <br>
            He springing in the saddle pressed the horse, <br>
            And fix'd, he sat him in the swiftest course: <br>
            An able vet'ran for the dusty plains, <br>
            And a just moderator of the reins. <br>
            Subdued by thee, when all their power was vain, <br>
            They bent their necks beneath the Roman chain.</p>
          <p>But these shall not suffice to speak thy praise, <br>
            Actions to come shall greater honours raise; <br>
            For I have more surprising things in view, <br>
            From omens sure as e'er Melampus knew. <br>
            For on that day when you, sublimely great, <br>
            Was clothed in purple and enrobed in state, <br>
            The sun above the ocean raised his head, <br>
            And o'er the earth uncommon lustre spread: <br>
            The seas with swelling billows rise no more, <br>
            But roll'd their silent waters to the shore ; <br>
            The struggling winds their noisy discord cease, <br>
            And every whispering gale lay hush'd in peace. <br>
            No bird did through the air his journey steer, <br>
            Or shook his whistling pinions in the air: <br>
            No savage beasts were grazing in the shade; <br>
            But all stood silent at the vows you made. <br>
             <pb n="380"/>
            Jove, in his chariot wafted through the air, <br>
            Left his Olympus to receive thy prayer ; <br>
            And seem'd intent to bend a listening ear. <br>
            Th' assenting power to every word you said <br>
            Gave the majestic nod, and waved his head: <br>
            Sudden the shining altars seem'd more bright, <br>
            And shooting flames diffused a greater light.</p>
          <p>The gods approve! begin the mighty deed, <br>
            For thee uncommon triumphs are decreed. <br>
            Not neighbouring Gallia shall confine thy course, <br>
            Nor vast Hispania with its savage force; <br>
            Nor wealthy confines which the Tyrians sow, <br>
            Nor where the Nile and great Choaspes flow; <br>
            Nor where swift Gyndes does the land divide, <br>
            The lasting proof of Cyrus' foolish pride ; <br>
            Nor where the waters through their sulph'rous veins <br>
            Diffuse the heat to Arectæan plains; <br>
            Nor that vast land where Thomyris bore sway, <br>
            And swift Araxes rolls his rapid way; <br>
            Nor vile Padæans at the farthest east, <br>
            Who load their tables with a hateful feast; <br>
            Nor where the Hebrus spreads his golden sand, <br>
            Nor where the Tanais laves the Scythian land.</p>
          <p>But why should I insist on these alone, <br>
            When thy vast conquest the whole world shall own : <br>
            For thee remains the distant British shore, <br>
            Unbent by Roman power, a conquest yet in store; <br>
            For thee remains the farthest torrid zone, <br>
            Regions remote, and countries yet unknown.</p>
          <p>For air does this terraqueous globe surround, <br>
            And five divisions in the orb are found; <br>
            Two parts whereof in chilly regions lie, <br>
            Perpetual frosts, and an inclement sky. <br>
            The earth is there with darkness wrapped around, <br>
            And sullen night sits brooding o'er the ground: <br>
            No living waters there the earth divide, <br>
            Nor cheerful streams in pleasant wand'rings glide ; <br>
            But everlasting ice the floods constrains, <br>
            And drifts of snow o'erspread the dreary plains; <br>
             <pb n="381"/>
            There never did :he sun diffuse a ray, <br>
            Or give the cheerful promise of a day.</p>
          <p>The middle regions feel the scorching sun, <br>
            Whether he nearer brings our summer on; <br>
            Or when he does a swifter course display, <br>
            And wheels in circles short the wintry day: <br>
            Therefore the plough is never there in use, <br>
            No corn the fields, nor herbs the lands produce: <br>
            No god indulgent makes the fields his care, <br>
            Bacchus and Ceres never visit there. <br>
            No cattle there can graze the smoking ground; <br>
            There nothing that possesses life is found.</p>
          <p>Between this freezing cold and scorching heat <br>
            Our temperate zone is placed, a happy seat: <br>
            To this opposed, a fellow climate lies, <br>
            The same meridian holds, and temperate skies. <br>
            Here first the stubborn steer to toil was broke, <br>
            And oxen bent their neck beneath the yoke. <br>
            Here vines were taught their flexile shoots to ease, <br>
            And hang their clusters on the neighbouring trees, <br>
            And annual harvest gave a large increase. <br>
            Here first the earth received the vexing plough, <br>
            And first the sea was raised with brazen prow: <br>
            Then by degrees at distance cities rise, <br>
            And swelling walls and towers divide the skies.</p>
          <p>Therefore where'er by fame thy acts are hurl'd, <br>
            They shall be known by all in either world. <br>
            For me, I cannot so much praise rehearse, <br>
            Though Phœbus should himself inspire my verse. <br>
            But Valgius, he can swell a warrior's name ; <br>
            Valgius, next Homer in eternal fame. <br>
            The works will not my leisure hours decay, <br>
            Though Fortune vexes me, as is her way.</p>
          <p>For I could once command a stately seat, <br>
            Splendidly wealthy, and sublimely great: <br>
            And yellow harvests waving o'er the plain, <br>
            Seem'd to o'ercrowd my fields with golden grain. <br>
            When my unnumbered flock of flocks were fled, <br>
            And o'er the hills in crowded herds were spread. <br>
             <pb n="382"/>
            Sufficient for their lord my lambs did stray, <br>
            And too, too many for the beasts of prey; <br>
            But now of every pleasing view bereft, <br>
            Reflection on their loss is all I've left. <br>
            Fresh grief I feel, and still repeated cares, <br>
            Oft as I cast my eye on former years.</p>
          <p>But though the Fates, with more severe decrees <br>
            Shall fix a train of heavier woes than these, <br>
            Yet still unwearied with my misery, <br>
            The Muse shall never fail to sing of thee.</p>
          <p>Nor will the Muse alone suffice to prove <br>
            How much I prize my friend, how much I love. <br>
            For thee I'd run the hazard of the sea, <br>
            And tempt the roughest of the waves for thee. <br>
            For thee I singly could whole troops oppose, <br>
            Or throw myself where flaming Ætna glows.</p>
          <p>And while I think you but regard my name, <br>
            I neither wish the Lydian realms to claim, <br>
            Nor the vast honours of Gylippus' fame: <br>
            Nor would I ask Apollo to inspire <br>
            My Muse with Homer's strength and lasting fire; <br>
            If but this humble verse can pleasing be, <br>
            No time shall stop my tongue from praising thee.</p>
          <p>And when I've suffer'd Fate's unalter'd doom, <br>
            Closed in the gloomy mansion of a tomb ; <br>
            If death in time shall make his forceful rape, <br>
            Or I survive, though in a different shape; <br>
            If as a horse I beat the dusty plain, <br>
            Or in a bull's majestic form remain; <br>
            Or if I as a feather'd fowl appear, <br>
            And beat with flutt'ring wings the fluid air; <br>
            Or in a human form increase my days, <br>
            I'll always fill whole volumes with thy praise. DART.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>GREAT god of war ! Sulpicia, lovely maid, <br>
            To grace your calends, is in pomp array'd. <br>
             <pb n="383"/>
            If beauty warms you, quit th' ethereal height, <br>
            E'en Cytherea will indulge the sight: <br>
            But while you gaze o'er all her matchless charms. <br>
            Beware your hands should meanly drop your arms ! <br>
            When Cupid would the gods with love surprise, <br>
            He lights his torches at her radiant eyes. <br>
            A secret grace her every act improves, <br>
            And pleasing follows wheresoe'er she moves: <br>
            If loose her hair upon her bosom plays, <br>
            Unnumbered charms that negligence betrays: <br>
            Or if 'tis plaited with a laboured care, <br>
            Alike the labour'd plaits become the fair. <br>
            Whether rich Tyrian robes her charms invest, <br>
            Or all in snowy white the nymph is drest, <br>
            All, all she graces, still supremely fair, <br>
            Still charms spectators with a fond despair. <br>
            A thousand dresses thus Vertumnus wears, <br>
            And beauteous equally in each appears.</p>
          <p>The richest tints and deepest Tyrian hue, <br>
            To thee, 0 wondrous maid ! are solely due: <br>
            To thee th' Arabian husbandman should bring <br>
            The spicy produce of his eastern spring: <br>
            Whatever gems the swarthy Indians boast, <br>
            Their shelly treasures, and their golden coast, <br>
            Alone thou merit'st! Come, ye tuneful choir ! <br>
            And come, bright Phoebus ! with thy plausive lyre ! <br>

            But oh beware ! lest, gazing on her charms, <br>
            Fierce as thou art, thou drop thy shameful arms. <br>
            For from her eyes, when gods are Cupid's aim, <br>

             <pb n="384"/>
            In every act, and step, and motion seen, <br>
            Grace stealthy glides, and forms her easy mien: <br>
            Graceful her locks in loose disorder spread ; <br>
            Graceful the smoother braid that binds her head <br>
            She charms, when Tyrian purple folds her limbs ; <br>
            She charms, when white her snowy drapery swims: <br>
            Thus blithe Vertumnus in th' Olympian hall <br>
            Shifts all his thousand shapes, and charms in all. <br>
            She only of her sex deserves the grain <br>
            Of wool twice dipped in Tyrus' crimson stain: <br>
            Hers to possess whatever the Arab reaps <br>
            Of harvest shrubs, whence liquid fragrance weeps: <br>
            Whatever pearls the sable Indian's hand <br>
            Culls on his eastern ocean's ruddy sand. <br>
            Her on these calends, 0 ye Muses ! sing: <br>
            Let thy shell'd harp, exulting Phoebus ! ring: <br>
            The festal rite let future years prolong; <br>

            Dry then your tears ; your tears would fitly flow <br>
            Did she on others her esteem bestow.</p>
          <p>0 come! what honour will be yours, to save <br>
            At once two lovers fisom the doleful grave ? <br>
            Then both will emulous exalt your skill; <br>

            Whenever fancy paints me to the boy, <br>
