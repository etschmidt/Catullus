        BALD heads forgetful of their sins,<br>  
        Old, learned, respectable bald heads<br>
        Edit and annotate the lines<br>
        That young men, tossing on their beds,<br>
        Rhymed out in love’s despair<br>
        To flatter beauty’s ignorant ear.

        They’ll cough in the ink to the world’s end;<br>
        Wear out the carpet with their shoes<br>
        Earning respect; have no strange friend;<br>
        If they have sinned nobody knows.<br>
        Lord, what would they say<br>
        Should their Catullus walk that way?
