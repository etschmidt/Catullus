<br>
<br>1. The Dedication: to Cornelius<br>
To whom do I send this fresh little book<br>
of wit, just polished off with dry pumice?<br>
To you, Cornelius: since you were accustomed<br>
to consider my trifles worth something<br>
even then, when you alone of Italians<br>
dared to explain all the ages, in three learned<br>
works, by Jupiter, and with the greatest labour.<br>
Then take this little book for your own: whatever<br>
it is, and is worth: virgin Muse, patroness,<br>
let it last, for more lives than one.<br>

<br>
<br>2. Tears for Lesbia’s Sparrow<br>
Sparrow, my sweet girl’s delight,<br>
whom she plays with, holds to her breast,<br>
whom, greedy, she gives her little finger to,<br>
often provoking you to a sharp bite,<br>
whenever my shining desire wishes<br>
to play with something she loves,<br>
I suppose, while strong passion abates,<br>
it might be a small relief from her pain:<br>
might I toy with you as she does<br>
and ease the cares of a sad mind!<br>

<br>2b. Atalanta<br>
It’s as pleasing to me as, they say,<br>
that golden apple was to the swift girl,<br>
that loosed her belt, too long tied.<br>

<br>
<br>3. The Death of Lesbia’s Sparrow<br>
Mourn, O you Loves and Cupids<br>
and such of you as love beauty:<br>
my girl’s sparrow is dead,<br>
sparrow, the girl’s delight,<br>
whom she loved more than her eyes.<br>
For he was sweet as honey, and knew her<br>
as well as the girl her own mother,<br>
he never moved from her lap,<br>
but, hopping about here and there,<br>
chirped to his mistress alone.<br>
Now he goes down the shadowy road<br>
from which they say no one returns.<br>
Now let evil be yours, evil shadows of Orcus,<br>
that devour everything of beauty:<br>
you’ve stolen lovely sparrow from me.<br>
O evil deed! O poor little sparrow!<br>
Now, by your efforts, my girl’s eyes<br>
are swollen and red with weeping.<br>

<br>
<br>4.  His Boat<br>
This boat you see, friends, will tell you<br>
that she was the fastest of craft,<br>
not to be challenged for speed<br>
by any vessel afloat, whether<br>
driven by sail or the labour of oars.<br>
The threatening Adriatic coast won’t deny it,<br>
nor the isles of the Cyclades,<br>
nor noble Rhodes, nor fearful Bosphorus,<br>
nor the grim bay of the Black Sea<br>
where, before becoming a boat, she was<br>
leafy wood: for on the heights of Cytorus<br>
she often hissed to the whispering leaves.<br>
The boat says these things were well known to you,<br>
and are, Amastris and box-wood clad Cytorus:<br>
she says from the very beginning she stood<br>
on your slope, that she dipped her oars<br>
in your water, and carried her owner from there<br>
over so many headstrong breakers,<br>
whether the wind cried from starboard<br>
or larboard, or whether Jupiter struck at the sheets<br>
on one side and the other, together:<br>
and no prayers to the gods of the shore were offered<br>
for her, when she came from a foreign sea<br>
here, as far as this limpid lake.<br>
But that’s past: now hidden away here<br>
she ages quietly and offers herself to you,<br>
Castor and his brother, heavenly Twins.<br>

<br>
<br>5. Let’s Live and Love: to Lesbia<br>
Let us live, my Lesbia, let us love,<br>
and all the words of the old, and so moral,<br>
may they be worth less than nothing to us!<br>
Suns may set, and suns may rise again:<br>
but when our brief light has set,<br>
night is one long everlasting sleep.<br>
Give me a thousand kisses, a hundred more,<br>
another thousand, and another hundred,<br>
and, when we’ve counted up the many thousands,<br>
confuse them so as not to know them all,<br>
so that no enemy may cast an evil eye,<br>
by knowing that there were so many kisses.<br>

<br>6. Flavius’s Girl: to Flavius<br>
Flavius, unless your delights<br>
were tasteless and inelegant,<br>
you’d want to tell, and couldn’t be silent.<br>
Surely you’re in love with some feverish<br>
little whore: you’re ashamed to confess it.<br>
Now, pointlessly silent, you don’t seem to be<br>
idle of nights, it’s proclaimed by your bed<br>
garlanded, fragrant with Syrian perfume,<br>
squashed cushions and pillows, here and there,<br>
and the trembling frame shaken,<br>
quivering and wandering about.<br>
But being silent does nothing for you.<br>
Why? Spread thighs blab it’s not so,<br>
if not quite what foolishness you commit.<br>
How and whatever you’ve got, good or bad,<br>
tell us. I want to name you and your loves<br>
to the heavens in charming verse.<br>

<br>
<br>7. How Many Kisses: to Lesbia<br>
Lesbia, you ask how many kisses of yours<br>
would be enough and more to satisfy me.<br>
As many as the grains of Libyan sand<br>
that lie between hot Jupiter’s oracle,<br>
at Ammon, in resin-producing Cyrene,<br>
and old Battiades sacred tomb:<br>
or as many as the stars, when night is still,<br>
gazing down on secret human desires:<br>
as many of your kisses kissed<br>
are enough, and more, for mad Catullus,<br>
as can’t be counted by spies<br>
nor an evil tongue bewitch us.<br>

<br>
<br>8. Advice: to himself<br>
Sad Catullus, stop playing the fool,<br>
and let what you know leads you to ruin, end.<br>
Once, bright days shone for you,<br>
when you came often drawn to the girl<br>
loved as no other will be loved by you.<br>
Then there were many pleasures with her,<br>
that you wished, and the girl not unwilling,<br>
truly the bright days shone for you.<br>
And now she no longer wants you: and you<br>
weak man, be unwilling to chase what flees,<br>
or live in misery: be strong-minded, stand firm.<br>
Goodbye girl, now Catullus is firm,<br>
he doesn’t search for you, won’t ask unwillingly.<br>
But you’ll grieve, when nobody asks.<br>
Woe to you, wicked girl, what life’s left for you?<br>
Who’ll submit to you now? Who’ll see your beauty?<br>
Who now will you love? Whose will they say you’ll be?<br>
Who will you kiss? Whose lips will you bite?<br>
But you, Catullus, be resolved to be firm.<br>

<br>
<br>9. Back from Spain: to Veranius<br>
Veranius, first to me of all<br>
my three hundred thousand friends,<br>
have you come home to your own house<br>
your harmonious brothers, and old mother?<br>
You’re back. O happy news for me!<br>
I’ll see you safe and sound and listen<br>
to your tales of Spanish places that you’ve done,<br>
and tribes, as is your custom, and<br>
hang about your neck, and kiss<br>
your lovely mouth and eyes.<br>
O who of all men is happier<br>
than I the gladdest and happiest?<br>

<br>
<br>10. Home Truths for Varus’s girl: to Varus<br>
Varus drags me into his affairs<br>
out of the Forum, where I’m seen idling:<br>
to a little whore I immediately saw,<br>
not very inelegant, not unattractive,<br>
who, when we came there, met us<br>
with varied chatter, including, how might<br>
Bithynia stand now, what’s it like, and where<br>
might the benefit have been to me in cash.<br>
I told her what’s true, nothing at all,<br>
while neither the praetors nor their aides,<br>
return any the richer, especially since<br>
our Praetor, Memmius, the bugger,<br>
cared not a jot for his followers.<br>
‘But surely,’ they said, you could have bought<br>
slaves they say are made for the litter there.’<br>
I, so the girl might take me to be wealthy,<br>
said ‘no, for me things weren’t so bad,<br>
that coming across one bad province,<br>
I couldn’t buy eight good men.’<br>
But I’d no one, neither here nor there,<br>
who might even raise to his shoulder<br>
the shattered foot of an old couch.<br>
At this she, like the shameless thing she was, said<br>
‘I beg you, my dear Catullus, for the loan of them,<br>
just for a while: I’d like to be carried<br>
to Serap’s temple.’ ‘Wait’ I said to the girl,<br>
‘what I just said was mine, isn’t actually in<br>
my possession: my friend Cinna, that’s Gaius,<br>
purchased the thing for himself.<br>
Whether they’re his or mine, what difference to me?<br>
I use them just as well as if I’d bought them myself.<br>
But you are quite tasteless, and annoying,<br>
you with whom no inexactness is allowed.’<br>

<br>
<br>11. Words against Lesbia: to Furius and Aurelius<br>
Furius and Aurelius, you friends of Catullus,<br>
whether he penetrates farthest India,<br>
where the Eastern waves strike the shore<br>
with deep resonance,<br>
or among the Hyrcanians and supple Arabs,<br>
or Sacians and Parthian bowmen,<br>
or where the seven-mouthed Nile<br>
colours the waters,<br>
or whether he’ll climb the high Alps,<br>
viewing great Caesar’s monuments,<br>
the waters of Gallic Rhine,<br>
and the furthest fierce Britons,<br>
whatever the will of the heavens<br>
brings, ready now for anything,<br>
tell my girl this in a few<br>
ill-omened words.<br>
Let her live and be happy with her adulterers,<br>
hold all three-hundred in her embrace,<br>
truly love-less, wearing them all down<br>
again and again: let her not look for<br>
my love as before,<br>
she whose crime destroyed it, like the last<br>
flower of the field, touched once<br>
by the passing plough.<br>

<br>
<br>12. Stop Stealing the Napkins! : to Asinius Marrucinus<br>
Asinius Marrucinus, you don’t employ<br>
your left hand too well: in wine and jest<br>
you take neglected table-linen.<br>
Do you think that’s witty? Get lost, you fool:<br>
it’s such a sordid and such an unattractive thing.<br>
Don’t you believe me? Believe Pollionus<br>
your brother, who wishes your thefts<br>
could be fixed by money: he’s a boy<br>
truly stuffed with wit and humour.<br>
So expect three hundred hendecasyllables<br>
or return my napkin, whose value<br>
doesn’t disturb me, truly,<br>
it’s a remembrance of my friends.<br>
Fabullus and Veranius sent me the gift,<br>
napkins from Spain: they must be cherished<br>
as my Veranius and Fabullus must be.<br>

<br>
<br>13. Invitation: to Fabullus<br>
You’ll dine well, in a few days, with me,<br>
if the gods are kind to you, my dear Fabullus,<br>
and if you bring lots of good food with you,<br>
and don’t come without a pretty girl<br>
and wine and wit and all your laughter.<br>
I say you’ll dine well, and charmingly,<br>
if you bring all that: since your Catullus’s<br>
purse alas is full of cobwebs.<br>
But accept endearments in return for the wine<br>
or whatever’s sweeter and finer:<br>
since I’ll give you a perfume my girl<br>
was given by the Loves and Cupids,<br>
and when you’ve smelt it, you’ll ask the gods<br>
to make you, Fabullus, all nose.<br>

<br>
<br>14. What a Book! : to Calvus the Poet<br>
If I didn’t love you more than my eyes,<br>
most delightful Calvus, I’d dislike you<br>
for this gift, with a true Vatinian dislike:<br>
Now what did I do and what did I say,<br>
to be so badly cursed with poets?<br>
Let the gods send ill-luck to that client<br>
who sent you so many wretches.<br>
But if, as I guess, Sulla the grammarian<br>
gave you this new and inventive gift,<br>
that’s no harm to me, it’s good and fine<br>
that your efforts aren’t all wasted.<br>
Great gods, an amazing, immortal book!<br>
That you sent, of course, to your Catullus,<br>
so he might immediately die,<br>
on the optimum day, in the Saturnalia!<br>
No you won’t get away with this crime.<br>
Now when it’s light enough I’ll run<br>
to the copyists bookstalls, I’ll acquire<br>
Caesius, Aquinus, Suffenus,<br>
all of the poisonous ones.<br>
And I’ll repay you for this suffering.<br>
Meanwhile farewell take yourself off, there,<br>
whence your unlucky feet brought you,<br>
cursed ones of the age, worst of poets.<br>

<br>
<br>15. A Warning: to Aurelius<br>
I commend myself and my love to you,<br>
Aurelius. I ask for modest indulgence,<br>
so, if you’ve ever had a desire in your mind<br>
you’ve pursued chastely and purely,<br>
keep this boy of mine modestly safe,<br>
I don’t speak to the masses – nothing to fear<br>
from those who pass to and fro in the streets<br>
occupied with their business –<br>
truly the fear’s of you and your cock<br>
dangerous to both good and bad boys.<br>
Shake it about as you please, and with as much<br>
force as you please, wherever you choose, outside:<br>
I except him from that, with modesty, I think.<br>
But if tempests of mind, and mad passion<br>
impel you to too much sin, you wretch,<br>
so you fill my boy’s head with deceptions,<br>
then let misery, and evil fate, be yours!<br>
Of him whom, with feet dragged apart, an open door,<br>
radishes and mullets pass through.<br>

<br>
<br>16. A Rebuke: to Aurelius and Furius<br>
I’ll fuck you and bugger you,<br>
Aurelius the pathic, and sodomite Furius,<br>
who thought you knew me from my verses,<br>
since they’re erotic, not modest enough.<br>
It suits the poet himself to be dutifully chaste,<br>
his verses not necessarily so at all:<br>
which, in short then, have wit and good taste<br>
even if they’re erotic, not modest enough,<br>
and as for that can incite to lust,<br>
I don’t speak to boys, but to hairy ones<br>
who can’t move their stiff loins.<br>
You, who read all these thousand kisses,<br>
you think I’m less of a man?<br>
I’ll fuck you, and I’ll bugger you.<br>

<br>
<br>17. The Town of Cologna Veneta<br>
O Cologna, who want a long bridge to sport on,<br>
and are ready to dance, though you fear<br>
the useless bridge-props with their<br>
much-patched standing timber,<br>
lest they tumble and lie in deep mud:<br>
let a good bridge be made for you as you desire<br>
where even leap-frogging priests are safe: but<br>
Cologna, give me that greatest gift, a good laugh.<br>
I want a fellow-citizen of mine to go head over heels<br>
straight into the deep mire from your bridge,<br>
since truly the whole pool and the putrid marsh<br>
is the blackest and deepest of chasms.<br>
The man’s totally dull, knows no more than<br>
a two-year-old child, asleep in its father’s trembling arms.<br>
Who, though he’s married a girl in her first flowering,<br>
a girl more delicate than a pretty little kid,<br>
needing to be tended more carefully than choicest grapes,<br>
let’s her play as she wishes, doesn’t care a fig,<br>
hasn’t risen to the occasion, but like an alder<br>
in a Ligurian ditch, crippled by the axe,<br>
feels as much of it all as if there were no woman there:<br>
Such is his stupor he doesn’t see, or hear me, he,<br>
who doesn’t know who he is, or whether he is or not.<br>
Now I want to toss him headlong from your bridge,<br>
if it’s possible suddenly to raise that stupefied dullness,<br>
and abandon that indolent mind in the heavy bog,<br>
as mules cast shoes into tenacious depths.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>21. Greedy: To Aurelius.<br>
Aurelius, father of hungers,<br>
you desire to fuck,<br>
not just these, but whoever my friends<br>
were, or are, or will be in future years.<br>
not secretly: now at the same time as you joke<br>
with one, you try clinging to him on every side.<br>
In vain: now my insidious cock<br>
will bugger you first.<br>
And, if you’re filled, I’ll say nothing:<br>
Now I’m grieving for him: you teach<br>
my boy, mine, to hunger and thirst.<br>
So lay off: while you’ve any shame,<br>
or you will end up being buggered.<br>

<br>
<br>22. People Who Live in Glass Houses: to Varus<br>
Varus, that Suffenus, thoroughly known to us,<br>
is a man who’s charming, witty, urbane,<br>
and the same man for ages has penned many verses.<br>
I think he’s written a thousand, ten thousand, or more,<br>
not those that are done on cheap manuscript<br>
paper: but princely papyri, new books,<br>
new roller ends, new red ties for the parchment,<br>
lead-ruled and smoothed all-over with pumice.<br>
When you read them, that lovely urbane Suffenus<br>
turns into a goat-herd or a ditch-digger:<br>
he’s so altered and strange.<br>
What should we think of it? He who might just now<br>
have been playing the fool, being witty with the thing,<br>
the same man’s crude, crude as a bumpkin,<br>
he mentions his poems as well, nor is there ever<br>
likewise anything as happy as the poems he writes:<br>
he delights in himself so, is so amazed by himself.<br>
Of course we’re all deceived in the same way, and<br>
there’s no one who can’t somehow or other be seen<br>
as a Suffenus. Whoever it is, is subject to error:<br>
we don’t see the pack on our own back.<br>

<br>
<br>23. Poverty: to Furius<br>
Furius, you who’ve neither slaves nor cash<br>
nor beetles nor spiders nor fire,<br>
truly have a father and step-mother,<br>
whose teeth can chew like flints:<br>
that’s fine for you, and your father<br>
and your father’s wooden wife.<br>
No wonder: since you’re all well,<br>
good digestion, nothing to fear,<br>
no flames, no weighty disasters,<br>
no wicked deeds, no threat of poison,<br>
no chance of further dangers.<br>
And you’ve a body drier than bone<br>
or whatever is most desiccated<br>
by heat and cold and hunger.<br>
Why wouldn’t you be well and happy?<br>
You’ve no sweat, no phlegm,<br>
or mucus, or evil cold in the head.<br>
To this cleanliness add more cleanliness,<br>
your arse is purer than a little salt-cellar,<br>
and doesn’t crap ten times in a year:<br>
and your shit’s harder than beans or pebbles.<br>
So if you rub it and crush it between your fingers,<br>
you can’t stain a single finger:<br>
it all suits you so happily Furius,<br>
don’t despise it, or consider it nothing,<br>
and cease to beg for that hundred sestertia<br>
you always ask for: sufficiency is riches.<br>

<br>
<br>24. Furius’s Poverty: to Iuventius<br>
Iuventius, who are our pride,<br>
not just now, for all times that have been,<br>
or will be hereafter in later years,<br>
rather surrender Midas’s riches<br>
to him, who has no slaves or cash,<br>
than allow yourself to be loved by him.<br>
‘Why, isn’t he a decent man?’ you ask. He is:<br>
but this decent man has no slaves or cash.<br>
Ignore it: disparage it as you may:<br>
he still has no slaves and no money.<br>

<br>
<br>25. My Things Back Please: to Thallus<br>
Thallus the sodomite, softer than rabbit’s fur<br>
or goose grease, or the little tip of the ear,<br>
or an old man’s slack penis mouldy with spider-webs,<br>
and that same Thallus more rapacious than a wild storm,<br>
when the sea-goddess reveals the yawning breakwaters,<br>
return my cloak, you pounced on,<br>
and Spanish napkin, and Bithynian painted ware,<br>
absurd man, that you ‘own’ openly like heirlooms.<br>
Now, unglue them from your talons, and return them,<br>
lest those soft little flanks and tender fingers<br>
are shamefully written over with the mark of the lash,<br>
and you toss immoderately, like a paltry boat<br>
caught in a heavy sea, in a raging wind.<br>

<br>
<br>26. The Mortgage: to Furius<br>
Furius, your little villa’s not exposed<br>
to the southerlies, or the westerlies,<br>
the savage north-wind, or the easterly breeze,<br>
but truly to fifteen thousand two hundred cash.<br>
O terrifying and destructive wind!<br>

<br>
<br>27. Falernian Wine<br>
Serving-boy fill for me stronger cups<br>
of old Falernian, since Postumia,<br>
the mistress’s, laws demand it,<br>
she who’s juicier then the juicy grape.<br>
But you water, fatal to wine, away with you:<br>
far off, wherever, be off to the strict.<br>
This wine is Bacchus’s own.<br>

<br>
<br>28. Patronage: to Veranus and Fabullus<br>
Followers of Piso, needy retinue,<br>
with suitable and ready packs,<br>
Veranius, the best, and you, my Fabullus,<br>
what possessions do you carry? Haven’t you borne<br>
hunger and cold enough with that good-for-nothing?<br>
Do any small gains show in the expense accounts,<br>
considering that I, following my praetor,<br>
repay what was spent, with small gain?<br>
O Memmius, truly, and daily, slowly<br>
buggered me backwards with that whole tree of his.<br>
But, as far as I can see, your case is the same:<br>
now you’re stuffed by no less a circumcised cock.<br>
Seek out the noble ones, my friends!<br>
But, to you, may the gods and goddesses bring<br>
much evil luck, disgraces to Romulus and Remus.<br>

<br>
<br>29. Catamite<br>
Who could see it, who could endure it,<br>
unless he were shameless, greedy, a gambler?<br>
Mamurra owns riches that Transalpine Gaul<br>
and furthest Britain once owned.<br>
Roman sodomite, do you see this and bear it?<br>
And now shall the man, arrogant, overbearing,<br>
flit through all of the beds<br>
like a whitish dove or an Adonis?<br>
Roman sodomite, do you see this and bear it?<br>
You’re shameless, greedy, a gambler.<br>
Surely it wasn’t for this, you, the unique leader,<br>
were in the furthest western isle,<br>
so that this loose-living tool of yours<br>
might squander two or three hundred times its worth?<br>
What is it but perverted generosity?<br>
Hasn’t he squandered enough, or been elevated enough?<br>
First his inheritance was well and truly spent,<br>
then the booty from Pontus, then<br>
Spain’s, to make three, as the gold-bearing Tagus knows:<br>
now be afraid for Gaul’s and Britain’s.<br>
Why cherish this evil? What’s he good for<br>
but to devour his rich patrimony?<br>
Was it for this, the city’s wealthiest,<br>
you, father-in law, son-in-law, wasted a world?<br>

<br>
<br>30. Faithlessness: to Alfenus<br>
Alfenus, negligent, false to the concord of pals,<br>
have you no sympathy now with your gentle friend?<br>
The impious deeds of deceitful men don’t please the gods.<br>
You neglect me and abandon me to miserable illness.<br>
Ah, say, what should men do, in whom should they trust?<br>
Surely you, unjustly, commanded my trust, seduced<br>
me to love, as if it were all quite safe for me.<br>
Now you withdraw, and all your vain actions and words<br>
you let slip on the winds, with the airy clouds.<br>
If you forget, the gods will remember, Faith remembers,<br>
so that whatever you do, you’ll soon repent of your deeds.<br>

<br>
<br>31. Sirmio<br>
Sirmio, jewel of islands, jewel of peninsulas,<br>
jewel of whatever is set in the bright waters<br>
or the great sea, or either ocean,<br>
with what joy, what pleasure I gaze at you,<br>
scarcely believing myself free of Thynia<br>
and the Bithynian fields, seeing you in safety.<br>
O what freedom from care is more joyful<br>
than when the mind lays down its burden,<br>
and weary, back home from foreign toil,<br>
we rest in the bed we longed for?<br>
This one moment’s worth all the labour.<br>
Hail, O lovely Sirmio, and rejoice as I rejoice,<br>
and you, O lake of Lydian waters, laugh<br>
with whatever of laughter lives here.<br>

<br>
<br>32. Siesta: to Ipsíthilla<br>
Please, my sweet Ipsíthilla,<br>
my delight, my charmer:<br>
tell me to come to you at siesta.<br>
And if you tell me, help it along,<br>
let no-one cover the sign at your threshold,<br>
nor you choose to step out of doors,<br>
but stay at home, and get ready<br>
for nine fucks, in succession, with me.<br>
Truly, if you should want it, let me know now:<br>
because lying here, fed, and indolently full,<br>
I’m making a hole in my tunic and cloak.<br>

<br>33. A Suggestion: to Vibennius<br>
O first of the bath-house thieves<br>
Vibennius the father, with sodomite son<br>
(since the father’s right hand is dirtier,<br>
and the son’s arse more all-consuming),<br>
why not go into exile, to some vile place?<br>
you can’t sell for a farthing.<br>
Seeing the father’s pillage is known<br>
to us all, and the son’s hairy arse,<br>

<br>
<br>34. Song: to Diana<br>
Under Diana’s protection,<br>
we pure girls, and boys:<br>
we pure boys, and girls,<br>
we sing of Diana.<br>
O, daughter of Latona,<br>
greatest child of great Jove,<br>
whose mother gave birth<br>
near the Delian olive,<br>
mistress of mountains<br>
and the green groves,<br>
the secret glades,<br>
and the sounding streams:<br>
you, called Juno Lucina<br>
in childbirth’s pains,<br>
you, called all-powerful Trivia,<br>
and Luna, of counterfeit daylight.<br>
Your monthly passage<br>
measures the course of the year,<br>
you fill the rustic farmer’s<br>
roof with good crops.<br>
Take whatever sacred name<br>
pleases you, be a sweet help<br>
to the people of Rome,<br>
as you have been of old.<br>

<br>
<br> 35. Cybele: to Caecilius<br>
Paper, I’d like you to say to Caecilius,<br>
that tender poet, that friend of mine,<br>
leave Lake Como, come now to Verona,<br>
abandon the town there and the shore.<br>
Because there are certain thoughts that I want<br>
him to hear of, from his friend and yours.<br>
So, if he’s wise, he’ll eat up the road,<br>
though some lovely girl calls to him<br>
asks his return, clasping both hands<br>
round his neck, and begging delay.<br>
Who, if the truth’s been told me now<br>
love’s him with violent desire.<br>
For, since the moment she read his unfinished<br>
Lady of Dindymus, the poor little thing<br>
has been eaten by fire to the core of her bones.<br>
I forgive you, girl, more learned<br>
than the Sapphic Muse: it’s truly lovely,<br>
Caecilius’s unfinished Great Mother Cybele.<br>

<br>
<br>36. Burnt-Offering: to Volusius’s Droppings<br>
Annals, of Volusius, papyrus droppings,<br>
discharge my girl’s votive offering.<br>
Since, by sacred Venus and Cupid, she promised,<br>
that if I were given back to her,<br>
and I left off launching wild iambics,<br>
she’d offer the gods the choicest words,<br>
of the worst of limping poets,<br>
consumed with malignant wood.<br>
And the girl thought this was the worst,<br>
with charming laughter, to move the gods.<br>
Now O goddess created from the blue sea,<br>
whose is holy Idalia, Urii, Ancona,<br>
reed-bound Cnidos, and Amathusia,<br>
Golgos, and Adriatic Dyrrachium,<br>
make the vow acceptable, fulfilled,<br>
if its not lacking in wit and charm.<br>
But meanwhile, you, enter the fire,<br>
you, full of boorishness and crudities,<br>
Volusian annals, papyrus droppings.<br>

<br>
<br>37. Free for All: to the Regulars and Egnatius<br>
Lecherous tavern, and you its regulars,<br>
nine pillars along from the Twins’ pillars,<br>
do you think you’re the only ones with cocks,<br>
the only ones who’re allowed to trouble<br>
young girls, and consider the rest of us goats?<br>
Or, because a hundred or two of you sit in a row, you,<br>
dullards, that I daren’t bugger two hundred together?<br>
Think on: I’ll draw all over the front<br>
of the tavern with your leavings.<br>
Because my girl, who’s left my arms,<br>
whom I loved as no other girl’s ever been loved,<br>
for whom so many great battles were fought,<br>
is there. You, all the rich and the fortunate, love her,<br>
and, what’s so shameful, it’s true, all the lesser ones,<br>
all the adulterous frequenters of by-ways:<br>
you, above all, one of the hairy ones,<br>
rabbit-faced offspring of Spain,<br>
Egnatius. Whom a shadowy beard improves,<br>
and teeth scrubbed with Iberian piss.<br>

<br>38. A Word Please: to Cornificius<br>
He’s ill, Cornificius, your Catullus,<br>
he’s ill, by Hercules, and it’s bad,<br>
and worse and worse by the hour.<br>
Where are you, for whom it’s the least and easiest thing,<br>
to bring consolation with chatter?<br>
I’m cross with you. So much for my friendship?<br>
Even a little might comfort me,<br>
sadder than Simonides’s tears.<br>

<br>
<br>39. Your Teeth! : to Egnatius<br>
Egnatius, because he has snow-white teeth,<br>
smiles all the time. If you’re a defendant<br>
in court, when the counsel draws tears,<br>
he smiles: if you’re in grief at the pyre<br>
of pious sons, the lone lorn mother weeping,<br>
he smiles. Whatever it is, wherever it is,<br>
whatever he’s doing, he smiles: he’s got a disease,<br>
neither polite, I would say, nor charming.<br>
So a reminder to you, from me, good Egnatius.<br>
If you were a Sabine or Tiburtine<br>
or a fat Umbrian, or plump Etruscan,<br>
or dark toothy Lanuvian, or from north of the Po,<br>
and I’ll mention my own Veronese too,<br>
or whoever else clean their teeth religiously,<br>
I’d still not want you to smile all the time:<br>
there’s nothing more foolish than foolishly smiling.<br>
Now you’re Spanish: in the country of Spain<br>
what each man pisses, he’s used to brushing<br>
his teeth and red gums with, every morning,<br>
so the fact that your teeth are so polished<br>
just shows you’re the more full of piss.<br>

<br>
<br>40. You want Fame? : to Ravidus<br>
What illness of mind, poor little Ravidus,<br>
drives you headlong onto my iambics?<br>
What god, badly-disposed towards you,<br>
intends to start a mad quarrel?<br>
Or is it to achieve vulgar fame?<br>
Why the assault? You want to be known everywhere?<br>
You will be, seeing you’ve wanted to love<br>
my love, and with a long punishment.<br>

<br>
<br>41. An Unreasonable Demand: to Ameana<br>
Ameana, a girl fucked by all,<br>
requires ten thousand from me,<br>
that girl with the ugly great nose,<br>
bankrupt Formianus’s ‘friend’.<br>
Gather round, you who care for the girl,<br>
assemble together, doctors and friends:<br>
the girl’s not well, don’t ask what it is:<br>
she’s suffering from fantasy money.<br>

<br>
<br>42. The Writing Tablets: to the Hendecasyllables<br>
Come, hendecasyllables, all that there are<br>
and from every side, as many as are.<br>
A base adulteress thinks I’m a joke,<br>
and refuses to give me my tablets<br>
once more, if you’d believe it.<br>
We’ll follow her: ask for them back.<br>
Which one, you may ask? The one you can see<br>
strutting disgracefully, laughing ridiculously,<br>
maddening, with the jaws of a Gaulish bitch.<br>
Surround her: ask for them back:<br>
‘Stinking adulteress, give back my letters,<br>
give back, stinking adulteress, my letters!’<br>
You won’t? O to the mire, the brothel,<br>
or if anything can be more ruinous, then that!<br>
But still don’t think that’s enough.<br>
Call her again in a louder voice:<br>
‘Stinking adulteress, give back my letters,<br>
give back, stinking adulteress, my letters!’<br>
But it’s no use: nothing disturbs her.<br>
We’d better change methods and tactics,<br>
if we want them to be of more use to us:<br>
let’s see if we can’t get a blush<br>
from that bitch’s brazen face.:<br>
‘Honest and chaste one, give back my letters.’<br>

<br>43. No Comparison: to Ameana<br>
Greetings, girl with a nose not the shortest,<br>
feet not so lovely, eyes not of the darkest,<br>
fingers not slender, mouth never healed,<br>
and a not excessively charming tongue,<br>
bankrupt Formianus’s ‘little friend’.<br>
And the Province pronounces you beautiful?<br>
To be compared to my Lesbia?<br>
O witless and ignorant age!<br>

<br>
<br>44. His Estate<br>
O my estate, whether you’re Sabine or Tiburtine<br>
(for they call you Tiburtine, who don’t wish to wound<br>
Catullus: but those who wish to do so say<br>
that whatever the bet is you’re Sabine),<br>
but whether you’re Sabine or Tiburtine,<br>
I willingly inhabit your suburban villa,<br>
and shake off a bad bronchial cough,<br>
given me by a stomach chill, my own fault,<br>
while stuffing extravagant dinners.<br>
For I wanted to be a guest of Sestius,<br>
so I read the oration in Antius’s case,<br>
full of legal poison and pestilence,<br>
it weakened me even to the extent<br>
of watery colds and frequent coughing,<br>
till I fled to your bosom, and restored<br>
my health, with rest and nettle-soup.<br>
Refreshed by which, I give you great thanks,<br>
who take no revenge on me for my error.<br>
Now I don’t care, if I take up that heinous<br>
script again, if it’s not me but Sestius himself,<br>
wheezing and coughing, who takes a chill,<br>
who invited me only after I’d read that vile work.<br>

<br>
<br>45. A Pastoral: to Septimius<br>
Septimius holding his beloved Acme<br>
in his lap, said: ‘Acme, mine, if I<br>
don’t love you desperately, and love forever,<br>
continually through all the years,<br>
as much as he who loves the most,<br>
in empty Libya and scorched India,<br>
I’ll fight against some green-eyed lion.’<br>
As he spoke, Love, to left and right,<br>
sneezed his approbation.<br>
But Acme lifted her head slightly<br>
and her charming red lips spoke<br>
to her sweet boy’s intoxicated eyes:<br>
‘So, Septimius, mea vita,<br>
let us always serve this one lord,<br>
that more deeply and more fiercely<br>
the fire will burn my tender marrow.’<br>
As she spoke, Love, to left and right<br>
sneezed his approbation.<br>
Now profiting from these good omens<br>
their mutual spirits love and are loved.<br>
Septimius sets his little Acme,<br>
above the Syrians or Britons:<br>
faithful Acme makes Septimius<br>
her one darling and desire.<br>
Who might see more blessed creatures<br>
who a love more fortunate?<br>

<br>
<br>46. Spring Parting<br>
Now Spring returns mild and temperate,<br>
now the wild equinoctial skies<br>
are calmed by Zephyr’s happier breezes.<br>
The fields of Phrygia will be forsaken,<br>
Catullus, rich farms of hot Nicaea:<br>
we’ll flee to Asia’s bright cities.<br>
Now restless minds long for travel,<br>
now the glad feet stir with pleasure.<br>
O sweet crowd of friends farewell,<br>
who came together from far places,<br>
whom divergent roads must carry.<br>

<br>
<br>47. Preferment: to Porcius and Socration<br>
Porcius and Socration, two left hands<br>
of Piso, the world’s itches and famines,<br>
that circumcised Priapus prefers you<br>
to my Veraniolus and my Fabullus?<br>
You, indulged with great sumptuous banquets<br>
every day: my friends<br>
looking for work at the crossroads?<br>

<br>
<br>48. Passion: to Iuventius<br>
Iuventius, if I were always allowed<br>
to kiss your honey-sweet eyes,<br>
I might kiss you three hundred<br>
thousand times, and never be sated,<br>
not even if my kisses were more<br>
than the crop’s ripe ears of wheat.<br>

<br>
<br>49. A Compliment: to Marcus Tullius Cicero<br>
Most fluent of Romulus’s descendants,<br>
that are, that have been, that will be<br>
through all the years, Marcus Tullius,<br>
Catullus sends you the warmest thanks,<br>
the least of all the poets, as much<br>
the least of all the poets, as you<br>
are the greatest of all lawyers.<br>

<br>
<br>50. Yesterday: to Licinius Calvus<br>
Yesterday, Calvus, idle day<br>
we played with my writing tablets,<br>
harmonising in being delightful:<br>
scribbling verses, each of us<br>
playing with metres, this and that,<br>
reciting together, through laughter and wine.<br>
And I left there fired with your charm,<br>
Calvus, and with your wit,<br>
so that, restless, I couldn’t enjoy food,<br>
or close my eyes quietly in sleep,<br>
but tossed the whole bed about wildly<br>
in passion, longing to see the light,<br>
so I might speak to you, and be with you.<br>
But afterwards I lay there wearied<br>
with effort, half-dead in the bed,<br>
I made this poem for you, pleasantly,<br>
from which you might gather my pain.<br>
Now beware of being rash, don’t reject<br>
my prayers I beg, my darling,<br>
lest Nemesis demand your punishment. She’s<br>
a powerful goddess. Beware of annoying her.<br>

<br>
<br>51 An Imitation of Sappho: to Lesbia<br>
He seems equal to the gods, to me, that man,<br>
if it’s possible more than just divine,<br>
who sitting over against you, endlessly<br>
sees you and hears you<br>
laughing so sweetly, that with fierce pain I’m robbed<br>
of all of my senses: because that moment<br>
I see you, Lesbia, nothing’s left of me.....<br>
but my tongue is numbed, and through my poor limbs<br>
fires are raging, the echo of your voice<br>
rings in both ears, my eyes are covered<br>
with the dark of night.<br>
‘Your idleness is loathsome Catullus:<br>
you delight in idleness, and too much posturing:<br>
idleness ruined the kings and the cities<br>
of former times.’<br>

<br>
<br>52. Injustice: on Nonnius<br>
Why, Catullus? Why wait to die?<br>
Nonnius the tumour sits in a Magistrate’s chair,<br>
Vatinius perjures himself for a Consulate:<br>
Why, Catullus? Why wait to die?<br>

<br>
<br>53. Laughter in Court: to Gaius Licinius Calvus<br>
I laughed when someone, from the crowd,<br>
while my Calvus explained the Vatinian case<br>
quite wonderfully, said admiringly, raising his hands:<br>
‘Great gods, what an eloquent little man!’<br>

<br>
<br>54. Oh Caesar! : of Otho’s head<br>
Otho’s head is quite tiny,<br>
and it’s owner’s legs loutishly unclean,<br>
soft and delicate is Libo’s farting:<br>
if not with all that, then let me displease you<br>
with Sufficio, old age renewed...<br>
again let my worthless iambics<br>
rile you, our one and only general.<br>

<br>
<br>55. Where are You? : to Camerius<br>
I beg you, if it’s not too much trouble,<br>
point out where your shade might be.<br>
You, little Camerius, I’ve looked for you,<br>
you, in the Circus, you, in the bookshops,<br>
you, in the sacred shrine of great Jove.<br>
I’ve detained all the girls together<br>
in Pompey’s Arcade, my friend,<br>
whose faces were blank, however.<br>
‘Worst of girls, reveal my Camerius’,<br>
so I demanded of them.<br>
One replied, revealing her nudity...<br>
‘Look he’s hiding in these rosy breasts.’<br>
But, oh it’s a labour of Hercules to bear with you:<br>
as much as your pride denies it, my friend.<br>
Since I’m not that bronze guardian of Crete,<br>
not Ladas or wing-footed Perseus,<br>
since I’m not carried by Pegasus in flight,<br>
nor by Rhesus’s swift snowy-white team,<br>
add to that feathered-feet and swiftness<br>
and the collective speed of the winds,<br>
Camerius you might have said who you were with:<br>
but I’d be weary right down to my marrow<br>
and devoured by excessive fatigue<br>
if I went on searching for you, my friend.<br>
Tell us where you’ll be in future, utter<br>
boldly, commit yourself, trust to the light.<br>
Do the milk-white girls hold you now?<br>
If your tongue’s stuck in your mouth,<br>
you’ll banish all the rewards of love.<br>
Venus delights in copious language.<br>
Or, if you want, fasten your lips,<br>
while letting me share in your loves.<br>

<br>
<br>56. Threesome: to Cato<br>
O Cato, an amusing ridiculous thing,<br>
worth your ears and your laughter!<br>
Cato laugh as you love Catullus:<br>
the thing is amusing, and quite ridiculous.<br>
I caught my girl’s little pupil thrusting away:<br>
if only to please Dione, I sacrificed him<br>
to my rigid succeeding shaft.<br>

<br>
<br>57. You Two! : to Caius Julius Caesar<br>
Beautifully matched the perverse buggers,<br>
Mamurra the catamite and Caesar.<br>
No wonder: both equally spotted,<br>
one from Formia, the other the City,<br>
marks that remain, not to be lessened.<br>
diseased the same, both of these twins,<br>
both somewhat skilled in the selfsame couch,<br>
this one no greedier an adulterer than that,<br>
rivals in shared little girls.<br>
Beautifully matched the perverse buggers.<br>

<br>58. Lament for Lesbia: to Marcus Caelius Rufus<br>
Caelius, our Lesbia, that Lesbia,<br>
that Lesbia, Catullus alone loved<br>
more than himself, and all of his own,<br>
now at crossroads, and down alleyways,<br>
jerks off the brave sons of Rome.<br>

<br>
<br>59. The Leavings: on Rufa<br>
Rufa from Bologna gives head to Rufulus,<br>
she’s Menenius’s wife, whom you’ve often seen,<br>
snatching food, from the pyre itself, in the cemetery,<br>
chasing the bread when it rolls from the flames,<br>
being thumped by the half-shaven cremator.<br>

<br>
<br>60. Lioness<br>
You now, did a lioness, from African mountains,<br>
or the depths of howling Scylla’s thighs,<br>
create you as hard and as foul as that,<br>
so you might show scorn for the voice of entreaty,<br>
in its latest misfortune, out of that oh too cruel heart?<br>

<br>
<br>61. Epithalamion: for Vinia and Manlius<br>
You, who live on Helicon’s<br>
hills, the son of Urania,<br>
who carry the tender virgin<br>
to her man, O Hymanaee Hymen,<br>
O Hymen Hymenaee:<br>
crown your brow with sweet flowers<br>
of marjoram fragrance,<br>
put on the glad veil, here,<br>
come, wearing the saffron shoes<br>
on your snow-white feet:<br>
summoned to the happy day<br>
singing the nuptial songs<br>
with ringing voice,<br>
strike your feet on the ground, shake<br>
the pine torch in your hand.<br>
Now Vinia comes to her Manlius,<br>
as Venus, adorning Mount Ida,<br>
came to Paris, her Phrygian judge,<br>
a rare girl wedded to rare fortune,<br>
like the myrtle of Asia born<br>
on the flowering branches,<br>
that the divine Hamadryads<br>
playfully tend themselves<br>
with shining dew.<br>
So come, suffer yourself to approach,<br>
leave the Aonian cave among<br>
the cliffs of Thespia,<br>
leave the nymph Aganippe<br>
and her cooling stream.<br>
And call the bride to her<br>
new husband’s loving home,<br>
her heart bound fast with love,<br>
as the clinging ivy enfolds the tree,<br>
winding here and there.<br>
And you chaste virgins too,<br>
whose own day will come,<br>
singing harmoniously<br>
cry,  O Hymanaee Hymen,<br>
O Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
That, hearing himself called<br>
to perform his service, he may<br>
suffer himself to approach,<br>
the commander of wedding joys,<br>
the true uniter-in-love.<br>
What greater god do you love<br>
sought out by lovers?<br>
What divine one do men<br>
worship more, O Hymanaee Hymen,<br>
O Hymen Hymenaee?<br>
You her trembling father<br>
invokes: for you<br>
the virgin belt’s untied:<br>
for you the bridegroom waits,<br>
fearful with new desire.<br>
You give the young girl fresh<br>
from her mother’s breast,<br>
to the young novice’s<br>
hands, O Hymanaee Hymen,<br>
O Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
Venus can take no advantage<br>
of what good custom allows,<br>
without you, but she can<br>
if you’re willing. What god dare<br>
compare with you in this?<br>
No house bears offspring<br>
without you, no parent can be<br>
brightened by children: but they can<br>
if you’re willing. What god dare<br>
compare with you in this?<br>
No ruler can set the boundaries<br>
to his country: but he can<br>
if you’re willing. What god dare<br>
compare with you in this?<br>
Open the lock of the door.<br>
The virgin comes. Do you see how<br>
the torches scatter brilliant sparks?<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
Noble shame holds back.<br>
However obedient she is,<br>
she weeps that she has to go.<br>
Don’t weep. There’s no danger<br>
to you Aurunculeia,<br>
nor will bright day see<br>
a lovelier girl than you<br>
rise from the Ocean waves.<br>
Such a hyacinth flower<br>
as blooms in a rich man’s<br>
colourful little garden.<br>
But you linger: the day vanishes.<br>
Let the new bride appear.<br>
Let the new bride appear, so<br>
she can now be viewed, and listen<br>
to my words. See? The torches<br>
scatter golden sparks:<br>
let the new bride appear.<br>
Your husband’s not fickle,<br>
given to sinful adulteries,<br>
chasing shameful vices,<br>
does not wish to flee from<br>
sleep in your tender breasts,<br>
and as the vines slowly wind<br>
about the trees they claim,<br>
he’ll be wound in your<br>
embrace. But the day vanishes:<br>
let the new bride appear.<br>
O bridal-bed, that for all<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
at the foot of the shining couch,<br>
comes to your master,<br>
what joy, what wandering<br>
night, what noon<br>
delights! But the day goes by:<br>
let the new bride appear.<br>
O, you boys, lift the torches:<br>
I see the flame approach.<br>
Come: let the song sound in harmony<br>
‘io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.’<br>
Don’t hold back the bold<br>
Fescennine laughter,<br>
don’t let this obedient concubine<br>
abandoning his master’s love<br>
deny the boys their nuts.<br>
Give nuts to the boys, you idle<br>
concubine! You’ve toyed<br>
with the nuts long enough:<br>
now be pleased to serve Hymen.<br>
Concubine, give them nuts.<br>
Girls seemed vile to you,<br>
concubine, yesterday, till today:<br>
now the hair-curler smooths<br>
your beard. Wretch of a wretch,<br>
concubine, give them nuts.<br>
You’ll speak ill of abstaining<br>
from your slaves, perfumed<br>
husband, but abstain.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
We know what’s allowed to you<br>
when you’re known to be single,<br>
but married it’s not allowed.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
Bride, beware you don’t deny<br>
what your man comes seeking,<br>
lest he goes seeking elsewhere.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
Powerful in your house,<br>
and happy in your powers,<br>
that act without you there,<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee,<br>
until with trembling motion<br>
white-haired old age<br>
nods at all and everything.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
In your saffron shoes cross<br>
the threshold with good omens,<br>
and enter the shining door.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
Look inside where your man<br>
lies on a Tyrian bed<br>
waiting for you alone.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
He no less than you<br>
burns with fire in his heart,<br>
but inwardly much greater.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
Page, let go the young<br>
girl’s shapely arm: now<br>
she reaches her husband’s bed.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
You good wives who know<br>
the powers of old to bring<br>
young girls to marriage.<br>
Io Hymen Hymenaee io,<br>
io Hymen Hymenaee.<br>
Now bridegroom, you may come:<br>
your wife waits in your bed,<br>
her lovely face gleaming,<br>
like a white poppy,<br>
on a saffron field.<br>
But, husband, let the gods<br>
joy, you are no less<br>
handsome, nor does Venus<br>
neglect you. But the daylight flies:<br>
come now, don’t delay.<br>
He’s not lingered:<br>
now he comes. Kind Venus<br>
shall aid you, since you desire<br>
openly what you desire, you<br>
won’t forget kind love.<br>
He who would count your joys,<br>
many thousands, must first<br>
tally the grains of Africa’s sands,<br>
and the glittering stars.<br>
Play as you wish, and quickly<br>
give her children. It’s not right<br>
for an ancient name to be<br>
childless, but it should create<br>
from the same root.<br>
I want a young Torquatus<br>
to stretch out his tender hand<br>
from his mother’s lap<br>
sweetly smiling to his father<br>
from half-open lips.<br>
Let him be like his father<br>
Manlius, let that be known<br>
by all the unknowing,<br>
and let his face reveal,<br>
his mother’s faithfulness.<br>
So our praise approves<br>
one born of a noble mother,<br>
just as unparalleled fame echoes<br>
from Penelope, the mother<br>
of excellent Telemachus.<br>
Close the doorways, virgins:<br>
we’re satisfied with our play. But you<br>
brave partners live truly, and<br>
do your duty constantly,<br>
with vigour and with joy.<br>

<br>
<br>62. Wedding Song<br>
Evening is here, young men, arise: evening, awaited<br>
so long by the heavens, barely still shows the light.<br>
Now is the time to rise, to leave the rich banquet,<br>
now the virgin comes, now the wedding-song is sung.<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
Do you see the unmarried girls, you young men?<br>
Rise to meet them: the evening star shows Thessalian fire.<br>
Such is the contest: see how they spring up so nimbly?<br>
Don’t fear to rise, they sing to win a partner.<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
The palm’s not easily won by us men as equals:<br>
consider, the girls need to prepare amongst themselves.<br>
not a vain preparation: they truly know what’s what:<br>
no wonder, since they concentrate their whole mind.<br>
Our minds are elsewhere: our ears turn elsewhere:<br>
so we’ll be defeated by willpower: victory needs attention.<br>
Therefore turn your minds to it at the least:<br>
now they begin to sing, now you must reply.<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
Hesperus what fire, they say, is crueller than yours?<br>
Who can tear a daughter away from her mother’s arms,<br>
from a mother’s detaining arms tear a daughter away,<br>
and give a virgin girl to an ardent young man.<br>
What do the enemy do that’s crueller, in capturing a city?<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
Hesperus, who shines with happier fire in the sky?<br>
You who strengthen the bond of marriage with your flame,<br>
with what men swear, swearing it to the parents,<br>
not to be joined together before your own brightness rises.<br>
What wished-for hour by the gods is more happily granted?<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
Hesperus has stolen one like us away.<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
And now at your rising the watchman always wakes,<br>
thieves hide by night, who often likewise return,<br>
Hesperus, you catch them, as your name alters, at dawn,<br>
but the girls love to slander you with false complaints.<br>
Why do they complain, if they secretly wish it then?<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
As the hidden flower born in the hedged garden<br>
unknown to the beasts, untouched by the plough,<br>
that the breezes sweeten, the sun strengthens, the rain feeds:<br>
that many young men would choose, and many young girls:<br>
when that same flower fades, plucked by a tender hand,<br>
no young boy would choose it, and no young girl:<br>
so the virgin, while she’s untouched, while she’s their love:<br>
if she loses her flower of chastity, her body dishonoured,<br>
she’s no longer the boy’s delight, the girls’ beloved.<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
As the vine we see, grown in the open field,<br>
never lifting its head, never bearing sweet grapes,<br>
its delicate stem bending downwards with the weight,<br>
so that in a moment its tallest shoot will touch its roots:<br>
no countryman, no farm-hand will cherish it:<br>
but if the same plant is fastened tight, wedded to an elm,<br>
many countrymen and farm-hands will cherish it.<br>
So a virgin who stays untouched, and uncultivated, ages:<br>
while taken in equal marriage, while the time is ripe,<br>
she’s loved more by the man, less hateful to her parents.<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>
And don’t you struggle with such a husband, girl.<br>
it’s not right to struggle, you, whose father gives you away,<br>
your father and your mother, who prepare you.<br>
Your virginity’s not wholly yours: part is your parents:<br>
a third your father’s, a third your mother’s,<br>
only a third is yours: don’t fight those two,<br>
who grant their rights to the son-in-law with the dowry.<br>
Hymen O Hymenaee, Hymen be near, O Hymenaee!<br>

<br>
<br>63. Of Berecynthia and Attis<br>
As soon as Attis, borne over the deep seas in a swift boat,<br>
had reached the Phrygian woods, with rapid eager steps,<br>
had returned to a dark corner of the goddess’s grove,<br>
goaded by mad fury, and there, his wits wandering<br>
had sliced off his testicles with a sharp stone,<br>
and had seen his remaining members devoid of power,<br>
and that country’s soil spotted with fresh blood,<br>
he took up the drum lightly in his pale hands,<br>
your drum, Cybele, yours, Great Mother, in your rite,<br>
and striking the sounding bull’s-hide with delicate fingers,<br>
chanted to his followers, as it quivered from his assault:<br>
‘Gallae, come, rise, to the high woods of Cybele, now,<br>
come, now, wandering cattle of Dindymus’s Lady,<br>
like exiles wandering here on an alien shore,<br>
followers of my way, lead by me, my friends,<br>
you suffered the swift seas and the wild waves<br>
and sheared your sex from your bodies with great hatred:<br>
gladden the Lady’s spirit with swift movements.<br>
Banish dull delay from your minds: come, now, follow,<br>
to Phrygian Cybele’s house, the Phrygian goddess’s grove,<br>
where the voice of the cymbal clashes, the drum echoes,<br>
where the Phrygian flute-player plays on a curving reed,<br>
where the ivy-crowned Maenads violently toss their heads,<br>
where they act out the sacred rites with high-pitched howls,<br>
where the goddess’s wandering retinue’s wont to hover,<br>
where we should hurry with our swift triple-step.’<br>
As Attis, the counterfeit woman, sings this to his friends,<br>
the Bacchic choir suddenly cries with quivering tongues,<br>
the drum echoes it gently, the hollow cymbals ring.<br>
The swift choir comes to green Ida on hurrying feet.<br>
Attis, leading, panting wildly, goading his scattered wits,<br>
enters the dark grove accompanied by the drum,<br>
like a wild heifer escaping the weight of the yoke:<br>
The agile Gallae follow their swift-footed leader.<br>
Then, since wearied, foodless, they reach Cybele’s grove,<br>
they’re seized by sleep from their excessive labours.<br>
Dull tiredness overwhelms eyes giving way to languor:<br>
mad frenzy vanishes in the calm of gentle breath.<br>
But when the Sun from his golden face scanned the bright<br>
heavens with radiant eye, the harsh earth, and wild sea,<br>
and dispelled the shadows of night with his lively steeds,<br>
then the Grace, Pasithea, takes swift Sleep, flying<br>
from the waking Attis, to her beating heart.<br>
So, rapidly, from sweet dream and free of madness,<br>
Attis recollected his actions in his thoughts,<br>
and saw with a clear heart what and where he had been,<br>
turning again with passionate mind to the sea.<br>
There gazing at the wide waters with tearful eyes<br>
he raised his voice and sadly bemoaned his homeland:<br>
‘Land that fathered me, land that mothered me,<br>
I, who left you so sadly, have reached the groves of Ida,<br>
like a slave fleeing his master, so am I among<br>
snows, and the frozen lairs of wild creatures,<br>
and should I in madness enter one of their dens<br>
where would I think to find you buried in those places?<br>
The keen eye itself desires to turn itself towards you,<br>
while my thought is free a while of the wild creatures.<br>
Have I been brought from my distant home for this grove?<br>
Shall I lose country, possessions, friends, kin?<br>
Shall I lose forum, wrestling ring, stadium and gymnasium?<br>
Sorrow on sorrow, again and again complaint in the heart.<br>
What form have I not been, what have I not performed?<br>
I a woman, I a young man, a youth, a boy,<br>
I the flower of the athletes, the glory of the wrestling ring:<br>
my doorway frequented, my threshold warm,<br>
my house was garlanded with wreaths of flowers,<br>
at the dawn separation from my bed.<br>
Now am I brought here priest and slave of divine Cybele?<br>
I, to be Maenad: a part of myself: a sterile man?<br>
I to worship on green Ida in a place cloaked in frozen snow?<br>
I to live my life beneath the high summits of Phrygia,<br>
where deer haunt the woods, where the wild boar roams?<br>
Now I grieve for what I did, now I repent.’<br>
As the swift sounds leave his rosy lips<br>
the fresh words reach the twin ears of the goddess,<br>
as Cybele is loosing the lions from their yoke<br>
and goading the left-hand beast: she spoke to it,<br>
saying: ‘Go now, be fierce, so you make him mad, so he<br>
is forced to return to the grove by the pain of his madness,<br>
he who desires to escape my rule so freely.<br>
Let your tail wound your back, let the lashes show,<br>
make the whole place echo to your bellowing roar,<br>
shake your red mane fiercely over your taut neck.’<br>
So Cybele spoke in threat and loosed the leash.<br>
The wild beast urging itself to speed, roused in spirit,<br>
tore away, roared, broke madly through the thickets.<br>
and when it reached the wet margin of the white sands,<br>
and saw delicate Attis near to the ocean waves,<br>
it charged. He fled demented to the wild wood:<br>
there to be ever enslaved, for the rest of his life.<br>
Goddess, Great Goddess, Cybele, Lady of Dindymus,<br>
Mistress, let all your anger be far from my house:<br>
make others aroused, make other men raving mad.<br>

<br>
<br>64. Of the Argonauts and an Epithalamium for Peleus and Thetis<br>
Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion<br>
floated through Neptune’s clear waves,<br>
to the River Phasis and Aeetes’s borders,<br>
with chosen men, oaks of the Argive people,<br>
hoping to steal the Golden Fleece of Colchis<br>
daring to course the salt deeps in their swift ship,<br>
sweeping the blue waters with fir-wood oars.<br>
The goddess herself who guards the heights of the city,<br>
who joined the curving fabric to pinewood keel,<br>
made their ship speed onwards with light winds.<br>
That vessel was first to explore the unknown sea:<br>
so, as she ploughed the windblown waters with her prow,<br>
and whitened the churning waves with foam from the oars,<br>
the Nereids lifted themselves from the dazzling white<br>
depths of the sea, amazed at this wonder of ocean.<br>
In those, and other days, mortal eyes saw the sea-nymphs<br>
raise themselves, bodies all naked, as far as their nipples,<br>
from the white depths.<br>
Then Peleus, they say, was inflamed with love of Thetis,<br>
then Thetis did not despise marriage with a mortal,<br>
then Jupiter himself agreed to Thetis’s marriage.<br>
O heroes, born in a chosen age, hail, godlike race!<br>
O offspring of a blessed mother, hail once more.<br>
Often I’ll address you, in my song.<br>
And I address you, so blessed in your fortunate marriage,<br>
chief of Pelian Thessaly, to whom Jupiter himself<br>
creator of gods, yielded his beloved:<br>
did not Thetis possess you, loveliest of Nereids?<br>
Did not Tethys allow you to lead off her grand-daughter,<br>
and Oceanus, who embraces the whole world with sea?<br>
When at the time appointed the longed-for flames arise,<br>
all of Thessaly crowds together to the palace,<br>
the halls are filled with a joyful assembly:<br>
they bring gifts with them, declaring their joy in their looks.<br>
Cieros is deserted: they leave Pthiotic Tempe,<br>
Crannon’s houses, and Larissa’s walls,<br>
they gather in Pharsalia, crowd under Pharsalia’s roofs.<br>
No one farms the fields, the necks of bullocks soften,<br>
nor does the curved hoe clear beneath the vines,<br>
nor does the ox drag earth outward with the blade,<br>
nor does the sickle thin the shade of leafy trees,<br>
coarse rust attacks the neglected plough.<br>
But the palace gleams bright with gold and silver<br>
through all the rich receding halls.<br>
The ivory chairs shine, cups glisten on tables,<br>
the whole palace gladdened with splendour of royal wealth.<br>
In the midst of the palace a sacred couch, truly joyful<br>
for the marriage of the goddess, gleaming with Indian ivory,<br>
stained with the red dyes won from purple murex.<br>
The cloth depicts in ancient forms, with marvellous art,<br>
in all their variety, the excellence of gods and men.<br>
Here are seen the wave-echoing shores of Naxos,<br>
Theseus, aboard his ship, vanishing swiftly, watched<br>
by Ariadne, ungovernable passion in her heart,<br>
not yet believing that she sees what she does see,<br>
still only just awoken from deceptive sleep,<br>
finding herself abandoned wretchedly to empty sands.<br>
But uncaring the hero fleeing strikes the deep with his oars,<br>
casting his vain promises to the stormy winds.<br>
The Minoan girl goes on gazing at the distance,<br>
with mournful eyes, like the statue of a Bacchante,<br>
gazes, alas, and swells with great waves of sorrow,<br>
no longer does the fine turban remain on her golden hair,<br>
no longer is she hidden by her lightly-concealing dress,<br>
no longer does the shapely band hold her milk-white breasts<br>
all of it scattered, slipping entirely from her body,<br>
plays about her feet in the salt flood.<br>
But, not caring now for turban or flowing dress, the lost girl<br>
gazed towards you, Theseus, with all her heart, spirit, mind.<br>
Wretched thing, for whom bright Venus reserved the thorny<br>
cares of constant mourning in your heart,<br>
from that time when it suited warlike Theseus,<br>
leaving the curving shores of Piraeus,<br>
to reach the Cretan regions of the unbending king.<br>
For then forced by cruel plague, they say,<br>
as punishment, to absolve the murder of Androgeos<br>
ten chosen young men of Athens and ten unmarried girls<br>
used to be given together as sacrifice to the Minotaur.<br>
With which evil the narrow walls were troubled until<br>
Theseus chose to offer himself for his dear Athens<br>
rather than such Athenian dead be carried un-dead to Crete.<br>
And so in a swift ship and with gentle breezes<br>
he came to great Minos and his proud halls.<br>
As soon as the royal girl cast her eye on him with desire,<br>
she whom the chaste bed nourished, breathing<br>
sweet perfumes in her mother’s gentle embrace,<br>
even as Eurotas’s streams surround a myrtle<br>
that sheds its varied colours on the spring breeze,<br>
she did not turn her blazing eyes away from him,<br>
till she conceived a flame through her whole body<br>
that burned utterly to the depths of her bones.<br>
Ah sadly the Boy incites inexorable passion<br>
in chaste hearts, he who mixes joy and pains for mortals,<br>
and she who rules Golgos and leafy Idalia,<br>
even she, who shakes the mind of a smitten girl,<br>
often sighing for a blonde-haired stranger!<br>
How many fears the girl suffers in her weak heart!<br>
How often she grows pallid: more so than pale gold.<br>
As Theseus went off eager to fight the savage monster<br>
either death approached or fame’s reward!<br>
Promising small gifts, not unwelcome or in vain,<br>
she made her prayers to the gods with closed lips.<br>
Now as a storm uproots a quivering branch of oak,<br>
or a cone-bearing pine with resinous bark, on the heights<br>
of Mount Taurus, twisting its unconquered strength<br>
in the wind (it falls headlong, far off, plucked out<br>
by the roots, shattering anything and everything in its way)<br>
so Theseus upended the conquered body of the beast<br>
its useless horns overthrown, emptied of breath.<br>
Then he turned back, unharmed, to great glory,<br>
guided by the wandering track of fine thread,<br>
so that his exit from the fickle labyrinth of the palace<br>
would not be prevented by some unnoticed error.<br>
But what should I relate, digressing further<br>
from my poem’s theme: the girl, abandoning<br>
her father’s sight, her sisters’ embraces, and lastly<br>
her mother’s, she wretched at her lost daughter’s joy<br>
in preferring the sweet love of Theseus to all this:<br>
or her being carried by ship to Naxos’s foaming shore,<br>
or her consort with uncaring heart vanishing,<br>
she conquered, her eyes softening in sleep?<br>
Often loud shrieks cried the frenzy in her ardent heart<br>
poured out from the depths of her breast,<br>
and then she would climb the steep cliffs in her grief,<br>
where the vast sea-surge stretches out to the view,<br>
then run against the waves into the salt tremor<br>
holding her soft clothes above her naked calves,<br>
and call out mournfully this last complaint,<br>
a frozen sob issuing from her wet face:<br>
‘False Theseus, is this why you take me from my father’s land,<br>
faithless man, to abandon me on a desert shore?<br>
Is this how you vanish, heedless of the god’s power,<br>
ah, uncaring, bearing home your accursed perjuries?<br>
Nothing could alter the measure of your cruel mind?<br>
No mercy was near to you, inexorable man,<br>
that you might take pity on my heart?<br>
Yet once you made promises to me in that flattering voice,<br>
you told me to hope, not for this misery<br>
but for joyful marriage, the longed-for wedding songs,<br>
all in vain, dispersed on the airy breezes.<br>
Now, no woman should believe a man’s pledges,<br>
or believe there’s any truth in a man’s words:<br>
when their minds are intent on their desire,<br>
they have no fear of oaths, don’t spare their promises:<br>
but as soon as the lust of their eager mind is slaked<br>
they fear no words, they care nothing for perjury.<br>
Surely I rescued you from the midst of the tempest<br>
of fate, and more, I gave up my half-brother,<br>
whom I abandoned to you with treachery at the end.<br>
For that I’m left to be torn apart by beasts, and a prey<br>
to sea-birds, unburied, when dead, in the scattered earth.<br>
What lioness whelped you under a desert rock,<br>
what sea conceived and spat you from foaming waves,<br>
what Syrtis, what fierce Scylla, what vast Charybdis,<br>
you who return me this, for the gift of your sweet life?<br>
If marriage with me was not in your heart,<br>
because you feared your old father’s cruel precepts,<br>
you could still have led me back to your house,<br>
where I would have served you, a slave happy in her task,<br>
washing your beautiful feet in clear water,<br>
covering your bed with the purple fabric.<br>
But why complain to the uncaring wind in vain?<br>
It is beyond evil, and without senses, unable<br>
to hear what is said, without voice to reply.<br>
It is already turning now towards mid-ocean,<br>
and nothing human appears in this waste of weed.<br>
So cruel chance taunts me in my last moments,<br>
even depriving my ears of my own lament.<br>
All-powerful Jupiter, if only the Athenian ships<br>
had not touched the shores of Cnossos, from the start,<br>
carrying their fatal cargo for the ungovernable bull,<br>
a faithless captain mooring his ropes to Crete,<br>
an evil guest, hiding a cruel purpose under a handsome<br>
appearance, finding rest in our halls!<br>
Now where can I return? What desperate hope<br>
depend on? Shall I seek out the slopes of Ida?<br>
But the cruel sea with its divisive depths<br>
of water separates me from them.<br>
Or shall I hope for my father’s help? Did I not leave him,<br>
to follow a man stained with my brother’s blood?<br>
Or should I trust in a husband’s love to console me?<br>
Who hardly bends slow oars in running from me?<br>
More, I’m alive on a lonely island without shelter,<br>
and no escape seen from the encircling ocean waves.<br>
No way to fly, no hope: all is mute,<br>
all is deserted, all speaks of ruin.<br>
Yet still my eyes do not droop in death,<br>
not till my senses have left my weary body,<br>
till true justice is handed down by the gods,<br>
and the divine help I pray for in my last hour.<br>
So you Eumenides who punish by avenging<br>
the crimes of men, your foreheads crowned<br>
with snaky hair, bearing anger in your breath,<br>
here, here, come to me, listen to my complaints,<br>
that I, wretched alas, force, weakened, burning,<br>
out of the marrow of my bones, blind with mad rage.<br>
Since these truths are born in the depths of my breast,<br>
you won’t allow my lament to pass you by,<br>
but as Theseus left me alone, through his intent,<br>
goddesses, by that will, pursue him and his with murder.’<br>
When these words had poured from her sad breast,<br>
the troubled girl praying for cruel actions,<br>
the chief of the gods nodded with unconquerable will:<br>
at which the earth and the cruel sea trembled<br>
and the glittering stars shook in the heavens.<br>
Now Theseus’s mind was filled with a dark mist<br>
and all the instructions he had held fixed in memory<br>
before this, were erased from his thoughts,<br>
failing to raise the sweet signal to his mourning father,<br>
when the harbour of Athens safely came in sight.<br>
For they say that when Aegeus parted from his son,<br>
as the goddess’s ship left the city, he yielded him<br>
to the wind’s embrace with these words:<br>
‘Son, more dear to me than my long life,<br>
son, whom I abandoned through chance uncertainty,<br>
lately returned to me in the last days of my old age,<br>
since my fate and your fierce virtue tear you away<br>
from me, against my will, whose failing eyes<br>
are not yet sated with my dear son’s face,<br>
I don’t send you off happily with joyful heart,<br>
or allow you to carry flags of good fortune,<br>
but start with the many sorrows in my mind,<br>
marring my white hairs with earth and sprinkled ashes,<br>
then hang unfinished canvas from the wandering mast,<br>
so the darkened sail of gloomy Spanish flax<br>
might speak the grief and passion in my mind.<br>
But if the one who dwells in sacred Iton, who promised<br>
to defend the people and city of Erectheus, allows you<br>
to wet your hand with the blood of the bull,<br>
then make sure this command is done, buried in your<br>
remembering heart, not to be erased by time:<br>
that as soon as you set eyes on our hills,<br>
strip the dark fabric fully from the yards,<br>
and hoist white sails with your twisted ropes,<br>
so that seeing them from the first, I’ll know joy<br>
in my glad heart, when a happy time reveals your return.’<br>
These words to Theseus, once held constantly in mind,<br>
vanished like clouds of snow struck by a blast of wind<br>
on the summits of high mountains.<br>
But when his father, searching the view from the citadel’s height,<br>
endless tears flooding his anxious eyes,<br>
first saw the sails of dark fabric,<br>
he threw himself head first from the height of the cliff,<br>
believing Theseus lost to inexorable fate.<br>
So fierce Theseus entered the palace in mourning<br>
for his father’s death, and knew the same grief of mind<br>
that he had caused neglected Ariadne,<br>
she who was gazing then where his ship had vanished<br>
pondering the many cares in her wounded heart.<br>
But bright Bacchus hurries from elsewhere<br>
with his chorus of Satyrs and Silenes from Nysa,<br>
seeking you, Ariadne, burning with love for you.<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
In rapture his Bacchantes raved madly, crazed in mind,<br>
with cries of ‘euhoe’ and tossing heads,<br>
some brandished the thyrsus with hidden tip,<br>
some flourished the torn limbs of bullocks,<br>
some wreathed themselves with twining snakes,<br>
some celebrated the secret rites of the hollow box,<br>
rights they wished the profane to hear in vain:<br>
others beat the drums with the flat of their hands,<br>
or raised a clear ringing from rounded cymbals:<br>
they blew endless strident calls on the horns<br>
and the barbarous flute shrilled with fearful tunes.<br>
Such the splendid workings of figured tapestry<br>
covering the sacred couch its cloth embraced.<br>
The people of Thessaly after gazing eagerly<br>
were satisfied, they began to leave the goddess’s sanctuary.<br>
As Zephyr stirs the willing waves, ruffling<br>
the placid sea with morning breeze,<br>
while Aurora rises to the wandering Sun’s threshold,<br>
so that at first they move slowly struck by a gentle blast,<br>
and their splashing resounds with slight lamentation,<br>
while afterwards they increase, swelling more and more,<br>
and reflect the red of the sunrise far-off as they rise:<br>
so, here and there, with wandering feet the crowd disperse<br>
to their homes, leaving the courtyard of the royal palace.<br>
After their departure Chiron, the Centaur’s leader,<br>
arrived from steep Pelion carrying woodland gifts:<br>
since what the fields bear, whatever the country of Thessaly<br>
yields on high peaks, whatever the flowers by the river’s waves<br>
the fecund breath of the warm west wind produces,<br>
he brought woven together in confused garlands,<br>
so that the palace smiled, charmed by happy fragrances.<br>
At once Peneus came to green Tempe,<br>
Tempe, whose hanging woods encircle it above,<br>
leaving Pasiphae to be honoured by the sea’s dance:<br>
not empty-handed, since he carried a tall beech<br>
by the roots, and long-leafed laurel from a straight trunk,<br>
and was not without nodding plane, and pliant poplar,<br>
scorched Phaethon’s sister, and airy cypress.<br>
He placed them woven, here and there, round the house<br>
till the courtyard was green, veiled with fresh foliage.<br>
Prometheus followed after him, skilled in mind,<br>
showing faint traces of his ancient punishment,<br>
when once he suffered, hung in tight chains<br>
from the high ledge of rock.<br>
Then the father of the gods with his sacred consort,<br>
and his sons, came down from the heavens,<br>
leaving behind only you, Phoebus, and the one born<br>
together with you, she who lives on the slopes of Ida:<br>
Peleus is still disdained by both you and your sister,<br>
and you will not celebrate Thetis’s wedding torches.<br>
Then the gods seated their limbs at the white benches,<br>
at tables richly heaped with various foods,<br>
while, moving their bodies in trembling dance,<br>
the Fates began to utter their prophetic song.<br>
Quivering seized their bodies, their white ankles<br>
wholly covered by the red hem of their dresses,<br>
and a red headband circling their white hair,<br>
and their hands were busy, as ever, at their eternal work.<br>
The left hand held the distaff, wound with soft wool,<br>
then the right, drawing out the thread lightly, shaped it<br>
with upturned fingers, then, twisting it under the thumb,<br>
turned the level spindle in smooth rotation,<br>
and often a plucking tooth made the strands equal,<br>
and fragments of wool, that once projected<br>
from the light threads, clung to their dry lips:<br>
and, before their feet, bright wool from a soft fleece<br>
was guarded by a basket woven of willow.<br>
Then in a clear voice, pushing away the fleece,<br>
they poured out these prophecies in divine song,<br>
song not to be proven wrong, by any amount of years.<br>
‘Defence of Thessaly, dearest of Jupiter’s scions,<br>
adding marvellous glory to your great powers,<br>
accept what the glad sisters bring to the light,<br>
true oracles: but you who accompany fate,<br>
fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
Now Hesperus comes to you bearing the longed-for<br>
bride, the wife approaches beneath a fortunate star,<br>
who pours out her heart to you with tender love,<br>
and prepares to lie with you in languid sleep,<br>
spreading her delicate arms beneath your strong neck.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
No house has ever sheltered such love,<br>
no love has ever joined lovers in such a union,<br>
even as harmony comes to Thetis, and Peleus.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
A child Achilles is born to you, free of fear,<br>
noted for never turning his back on an enemy, strong<br>
of heart, who, often the victor in the fickle foot-race,<br>
outstrips the swift deer with fiery hooves.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
No hero dare confront him in battle,<br>
when the Phrygian rivers flow with the blood of Teucer’s people,<br>
and the third heir of deceitful Pelops lays waste<br>
the walls of Troy, besieged in the weary war.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
Often women at the funerals of their sons lament<br>
his illustrious powers and bright deeds,<br>
as neglected hair streams down from their white heads,<br>
and weak hands mark their withered breasts.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
Now, as a reaper prematurely mowing the dense stalks,<br>
scythes the golden fields under his eager feet,<br>
he destroys the Trojan bodies with his fierce blade.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
Scamander’s waves that pour down in cascade to the swift<br>
Hellespont will bear witness to his great courage,<br>
its passage narrowed by the heaped bodies of the dead,<br>
the deep waters mixed with warm blood.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
At last it will be witness also to a death-prize payed,<br>
when a heaped tomb by the high rampart receives<br>
the smooth white body of a sacrificed virgin girl.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
Then as luck grants the riches of the Trojan city<br>
to the weary Greeks, loosening Neptune’s bond,<br>
the high mound will be soaked with Polyxena’s blood:<br>
who bowing like a sacrifice to the two-edged blade<br>
will fall to her knees, a maimed corpse.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
So perform the wishes of your hearts, join in love.<br>
Let the husband accept his goddess in joyful contract,<br>
now the bride be given to her loving partner.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.<br>
The nurse returning at daybreak will not<br>
encircle her neck with yesterday’s ribbon,<br>
nor the anxious mother by the sad bed of a troubled daughter,<br>
forgo the hope of dear grandchildren.<br>
Fly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.’<br>
Such the song once sung of happy prophecy<br>
to Peleus, from the Parcae’s divine hearts.<br>
Once the gods in person visited the pure houses of heroes,<br>
and showed themselves to the mortal crowd,<br>
the gods were not yet used to men’s scorn for piety.<br>
Often the father of the gods revisiting his bright temple,<br>
when the annual rites came round on the holy days,<br>
saw a hundred bulls lying on the ground.<br>
Wandering Bacchus often lead the shouting Bacchantes,<br>
with their flowing hair, on the high peak of Parnassus,<br>
when all rushing in emulation from the happy town<br>
of Delphos received the god with smoking altars.<br>
Often in the fatal struggles of war, Mars, or swift Minerva<br>
the lady of Lake Tritonis, or virgin Artemis<br>
appeared to exhort the crowds of armed men.<br>
But afterwards earth was tainted by impious wickedness<br>
and all fled from justice with eager minds,<br>
the brother’s hand was stained with a brother’s blood,<br>
the child ceased to mourn for its dead parents,<br>
the father chose the a younger son’s death to acquire<br>
a single woman in her prime, the impious mother<br>
spread herself beneath the unknowing son,<br>
not afraid of desecrating the household shrine.<br>
All piety was confused with impiety in evil frenzy<br>
turning the righteous will of the gods from us.<br>
So such as they do not visit our marriages,<br>
nor allow themselves to approach us, in the light of day.<br>

<br>
<br>65. The Promise: to Hortalus<br>
Though I’m continually worn out by grief’s pain,<br>
removed, Hortalus, from the learned girls,<br>
unable to bear the sweet fruit of the Muses,<br>
the mind troubled by so many dark feelings<br>
(for lately the flowing water in Lethe’s depths<br>
washes at my brother’s pallid feet,<br>
whom, torn from my eyes, the earth crushes<br>
beneath the shore of Trojan Rhoeteum.<br>
Am I never to see you hereafter, brother<br>
more lovely than life? But I will always love you,<br>
it’s true, always sing your death in mournful song,<br>
as Daulian Procne sings in the dense shadow<br>
of branches, lamenting dead Itylus’s fate)<br>
even in such great sadness, Hortalus, I still send you<br>
these verses in imitation of Callimachus,<br>
lest you might think your words for no good reason<br>
had been lost from my mind on the passing wind,<br>
as the apple sent as a secret gift from a lover<br>
rolls from the chaste girl’s breast,<br>
placed under the soft clothing, sadly forgotten,<br>
until, as she springs up at her mother’s approach,<br>
it’s shaken out, and rolls down in headlong descent,<br>
leaving a knowing blush on her sad face.<br>

<br>
<br>66. The Lock of Hair: Berenice<br>
He who gazed at all the lights in the vast heavens,<br>
who learnt the rise and setting of the stars,<br>
how the fiery beauty of the swift sun’s darkened,<br>
how constellations vanish at fixed times,<br>
how sweet love entices Diana, secretly passing<br>
near the Latmian cliffs, in her airy course:<br>
that same Conon, the astronomer, saw me shining brightly<br>
at heaven’s threshold, a lock of hair from Berenice’s head,<br>
she who stretching out her delicate arms<br>
made promises to a multitude of gods,<br>
at that time when the great king newly married<br>
was gone to lay waste the borders of Assyria,<br>
bearing sweet traces of nocturnal strife,<br>
those that are brought about by virgin spoils.<br>
Is Venus really hated by new brides? Is parents’ joy<br>
deceived by their false tears, shed copiously within<br>
the threshold of the bed? If it were truth they sighed<br>
they’d not have supported my divinity so. <br>
My queen taught me that, with her many woeful cries,<br>
when her new husband went off to grim battle.<br>
And is it not the bereavement of an empty bed you mourn,<br>
but the tearful separation from a dear brother?<br>
How sad cares eat at the heart’s core from within!<br>
As though, troubled, your mind is wholly lost,<br>
robbed of all feeling in your breast!<br>
But I recognise true greatness in a girl.<br>
Surely that brave act is not forgotten by which a husband’s<br>
kingdom was gained, that no one stronger dared?<br>
But what sad words were said in sending off this husband!<br>
Jupiter, how often your eyes were brushed by your hand!<br>
What god has changed you so? Or is it a lovers wish<br>
not to be absent from the beloved body for long?’<br>
And, there too, you promised me, to all the gods,<br>
not without blood of bulls, for your dear husband,<br>
if it brought his return. It did not take him long<br>
to add captive Asia to the bounds of Egypt.<br>
I discharge former promises, for those deeds,<br>
by this new tribute that joins me to the heavens.<br>
Unwillingly, O Queen, I was parted from your hair,<br>
unwillingly: I swear it by you and that head of yours,<br>
that is worthy, even though one were to swear in vain:<br>
but who could claim to be equal to steel itself?<br>
Even the mountain’s overthrown by it, the greatest<br>
bright child of Macedonia’s shores, over-passed<br>
when the Persians created a new sea, when barbarians<br>
drove their fleet through the midst of Athos.<br>
What can hair do when such things fall to the blade?<br>
By Jupiter, that the tribe of Chalybes might all perish,<br>
and those who first pursued the search for veins of metal<br>
below the earth, and how to cut tough things with iron!<br>
A little while ago the sisters were mourning my fate<br>
as a shorn lock, when, out of Locri, Arsínoe sent<br>
the winged horses of Ethiopian Memnon himself,<br>
beating, with quivering wings, Zephyrus’s,<br>
the West Wind’s, air, the brother born with him,<br>
and carrying me through the shadowed sky, he flew,<br>
and placed me in chaste Venus’s lap.<br>
Arsínoe herself sent her servant there,<br>
Greek inhabitant of the Canoptic shore.<br>
My arrival changed the heavens, so the golden crown<br>
from Ariadne’s brow might not be fixed alone<br>
in the bright sky: but, so that I too might shine,<br>
a faithful spoil of that golden hair, the goddess<br>
passing, wet from the flood, to the gods’ temple,<br>
placed me as a new constellation among the old.<br>
For, touching the Virgin’s stars and the savage Lion,<br>
joined to Callisto daughter of Lycaon,<br>
I fall towards the west, leading slow Bootës,<br>
who merges tardily with the deep Ocean.<br>
But though the footsteps of the gods touch me by night,<br>
light still returns me to the ancient sea.<br>
(Let this be known, by your leave, Fate, Virgin Ramnusia,<br>
since I hide nothing of the truth through fear,<br>
nor though the stars disperse me with angry words,<br>
do I choose to hide the buried truth of the heart.)<br>
I don’t delight in these things, as much as I suffer<br>
from being parted, parted from my lady’s hair,<br>
with which, when the girl used to try out<br>
all perfumes, I myself absorbed many thousands.<br>
Now you, whom the longed-for marriage torches join,<br>
don’t surrender your bodies to mutual embrace,<br>
baring your breasts with clothes removed,<br>
before the onyx delights me with its pleasing gift,<br>
your onyx, you who by right adorn the chaste bed.<br>
But she who gives herself to impure adulteries,<br>
let her absorb from sin the vain gift of light dust:<br>
since I seek no prize from the undeserving.<br>
But let great harmony, O brides, always inhabit<br>
your house, continual love always.<br>
You, my Queen, when you see your divine constellation,<br>
as you placate Venus with festive lights,<br>
don’t leave me free of your perfumes,<br>
but endow me with more great gifts.<br>
I wish that the stars would fall! I’d become royal hair,<br>
and then let Orion shine next to Aquarius!<br>

<br>
<br>67. Of Someone’s Adulterous Door<br>
O hail, sweet door, pleasing to a husband, pleasing<br>
to a father, and may Jupiter add his virtuous power to you,<br>
who served Balbus faithfully, they say, for a good while,<br>
when the old man owned the house himself,<br>
and served the son, on the contrary, quite badly, it’s said,<br>
when you became a wedding gift with the old man dead.<br>
Come on, tell us, why exhibit this change<br>
deserting old loyalties of ownership?<br>
‘It’s not my fault (I please this Caecilius, I’m handed<br>
over to now), though it’s said to be mine,<br>
it’s no sin of mine that anyone can say anything:<br>
truly a door of your people answers you,<br>
me, to whom whenever some ill deed’s discovered<br>
all cry out: “It’s your fault, door.”’<br>
It’s not enough to say that, with a word,<br>
but you must do what anyone might see and know.<br>
‘How can I? No one asks or takes the trouble to know?’<br>
I will, tell me, don’t hesitate.<br>
‘Well first, the virgin, they say, who was handed over to us,<br>
was false. The husband wasn’t the first to touch her,<br>
he whose sword hangs limper than a tender beet,<br>
never lifting the middle of his tunic:<br>
but they say the father violated his son’s bed,<br>
and disgraced the unfortunate house,<br>
either because his impious mind burned with blind lust,<br>
or because the son was useless, with barren seed,<br>
so it was necessary to search for one more vigorous,<br>
who could undo her virgin tie.’<br>
You tell of an illustrious father with amazing piety.<br>
who comes in his own son’s lap.<br>
‘And Brescia under the cliffs of Cycnea,<br>
that golden Mella with sweet water runs by,<br>
Brescia dear mother of my Verona, says <br>
he isn’t the only one known to have had her,<br>
but speaks of Postumius and Cornelius with passion,<br>
with whom she commited wicked adultery.<br>
Here someone will have said? “How do you know,<br>
door, never allowed to leave your master’s threshold,<br>
or overhear people, but fixed to this post,<br>
so accustomed to opening and closing the house?”<br>
I’ve often heard her alone in a furtive voice<br>
speak to her maids about her sins,<br>
the names I’ve said being spoken, she expecting<br>
that I’d have neither speech nor hearing.<br>
Besides, she added, someone else, whose name<br>
I don’t want to say, lest he raise his red eyebrow.<br>
He’s a tall man, who fought a great lawsuit once,<br>

<br>about a false pregnancy in a lying womb.’<br>

<br>
<br>68. Friendship: to Manlius<br>
That you send this letter to me, written with tears,<br>
to me, crushed by fate and bitter ill-fortune,<br>
that I might raise up, and return from the threshold of death<br>
one shipwrecked, cast from the foaming waves of the sea,<br>
one whom sacred Venus deprives of gentle sleep,<br>
forsaken, enduring an empty bed, not delighting<br>
in the sweet songs of the Muse of the ancient poets,<br>
lying awake all night with an anxious mind:<br>
that’s pleasing to me, since you call me your friend,<br>
and search here for the gifts of the Muses and Venus.<br>
But in case my troubles aren’t known to you, Manlius,<br>
or you think I dislike the duties of a friend,<br>
let me tell of waves of misfortune that I myself plunge in,<br>
lest you seek rich gifts any more from a wretched man.<br>
At that time when the first white toga was handed me,<br>
when my youth passed in flower through happy spring,<br>
I played more than enough: the goddess was not unknown to me,<br>
the work that mixed bitter with sweet.<br>
But all my studies were lost in the grief at my brother’s death.<br>
O wretched, to take my brother from me:<br>
you brother, you, in dying, wrecked my good fortune,<br>
with you our whole house is buried together,<br>
with you all our joys perish in one,<br>
that your love nourished in sweet life.<br>
So that ruined in thought I forsake those studies<br>
and all the delights of the mind.<br>
Therefore, when you say that it’s shameful for Catullus<br>
to be in Verona, that here someone well-known<br>
only warms cold limbs in an empty bed,<br>
it’s not shameful, Manlius, my sadness is great.<br>
So pardon me if I don’t bestow those gifts on you<br>
that grief takes from me, while I cannot.<br>
Since there’s no great store of books here with me,<br>
it needs me to be living in Rome: there’s my house,<br>
there’s my place, there my time is spent:<br>
only one of my many book-boxes follows me here.<br>
since it’s so, don’t think I do anything with ill intent,<br>
or that I’m lacking at all in noble feeling:<br>
it’s on you and no other I seek to lavish riches:<br>
besides I’d offer whatever riches I had.<br>

<br>
<br>68b. Commemoration: to Allius<br>
I can’t conceal, goddesses, the things of mine<br>
Allius helped with, or how many services he’s performed,<br>
lest fleeting time in forgetful ages<br>
hides this kindness of his in blind night:<br>
but I tell it to you: speak to many future thousands<br>
and let this paper speak in its old age,<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
and let the dead become more and more famous,<br>
don’t let the spider spinning its fine web on high<br>
perform its task on Allius’s neglected name.<br>
For you know how fickle Venus would have troubled me,<br>
and in what way she might have scorched me,<br>
when I might have burned like the Sicilian rocks,<br>
or the waters of Malis at Oetaean Thermopylae,<br>
my grieving eyes not have ceased to melt with endless tears,<br>
my cheeks to have been drenched with a saddened rain.<br>
Then like a mountain stream shining on airy heights,<br>
springing from mossy rock, that, having fallen<br>
headlong from sloping valleys, passes<br>
through the midst of densely populated regions,<br>
sweet comfort to travellers’ weary labour,<br>
when fierce heat splits the dried-up fields:<br>
like to a favourable wind that comes breathing lightly<br>
to the sailor tossed in the black tempest,<br>
now praying to Pollux, now imploring Castor,<br>
such was Allius’s help to me.<br>
He opened the closed field with a wide path,<br>
and granted my self and my girl a house,<br>
where we carried on our mutual affair,<br>
to which my bright goddess repaired<br>
with gentle steps, set her graceful sandals<br>
on the worn threshold, rested her shining feet,<br>
as once with blazing passion Laodamia came<br>
to the house, begun in vain, of Protesilaus<br>
her husband, the sacrifice not yet appeasing<br>
the gods’ love of sacred blood.<br>
Let nothing please me much, Fate, Ramnusian Virgin,<br>
that you by chance may receive unwillingly.<br>
Laodamia learnt from the loss of her husband<br>
how the hungry altar desires holy blood:<br>
she was forced to loose her new spouse’s neck,<br>
before one winter, and another returning,<br>
had sated eager love with their long nights,<br>
so she might learn to live without a lost husband,<br>
whom the Fates knew would not live long<br>
if he went as a soldier to the walls of Troy.<br>
For now Helen’s abduction had forced<br>
the Greek nobles to rouse their men for Troy,<br>
Troy (the evil!) a common grave for Asia and Europe,<br>
Troy the bitter ruin of men and of all virtue,<br>
have you not even brought my brother’s death.<br>
Oh alas for the brother taken from me,<br>
oh alas the shining light of a brother lost,<br>
with you our whole house is buried together,<br>
with you all our joys perish in one,<br>
that your love nourished in sweet life.<br>
You who, far away, are not interred among famous tombs,<br>
nor near the ashes of the known,<br>
but vile Troy, unhappy Troy, holds your grave,<br>
in the furthest soil of an alien land.<br>
To which they say the men of Greece hurried<br>
from every side, deserting their household shrines,<br>
lest Paris, delighted, carried off at leisure,<br>
to a peaceful bed, the adulteress he’d abducted.<br>
Through your misfortune, then, loveliest Laodamia<br>
your husband was taken from you, dearer to you<br>
than life and spirit: love’s passion, swallowing you<br>
in a whirlpool, carried you into the steep abyss,<br>
as they say the soil of Greek Pheneus near Cyllene<br>
dried up, when the thick swamp was drained,<br>
that Hercules, the divinely-fathered, once dared to lance,<br>
in the hacked out marrow of the mountains,<br>
when his sure arrows struck the Stymphalian birds,<br>
at a worse master’s command, so that the threshold<br>
of the heavens might be frequented by more gods,<br>
and Hebe might not long remain a virgin.<br>
But your deep love, that taught an untamed girl<br>
to bear the yoke, was deeper still than that abyss.<br>
Since the grandchild nursed by an only daughter,<br>
is not as dear to her father, child of his old age,<br>
that, when the child’s name  is barely entered<br>
in the grandfather’s will, disposing of his riches,<br>
removing the scornful family’s impious joy,<br>
scatters the vultures from his white head:<br>
no spouse was ever as pleasing to a white dove,<br>
that they say often sinfully gives far more kisses<br>
nipping with its beak, than any woman<br>
who beyond measure longs for as much.<br>
But you alone outdo their great passion,<br>
you who are won for ever by a golden-haired man.<br>
You to whom the light of my life conceded little<br>
or nothing in worth, when she gave herself<br>
into my lap, who often shone, with Cupid<br>
running about her, bright in his saffron tunic.<br>
Even if she’s still not content with Catullus alone,<br>
I’ll suffer the infrequent affairs of a shy mistress,<br>
lest I’m too annoying in the manner of fools.<br>
Often even Juno, greatest of goddesses,<br>
swallows her burning anger with her spouse’s sins,<br>
knowing the many affairs of all-willing Jupiter.<br>
And men are not to be compared with the gods,<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
bear the thankless burden of a worried father.<br>
Yet, led by no father’s hand, she comes to me,<br>
to the house, fragrant with Assyrian perfumes,<br>
brings me the marvellous gift in the secret night,<br>
she herself, stolen away from her husband’s breast.<br>
And that is enough, if that alone’s granted to me,<br>
that she marks out that day with a brighter light.<br>
This then Allius, for you, what I can, a gift<br>
made of song, in return for your friendship,<br>
lest this day and that, and others on others<br>
touch your name with corrosions of rust.<br>
And let the gods add more to this, those gifts<br>
Themis once used to bring to the pious of old.<br>
May you be happy, both you and your life,<br>
both your house in which we joyed, and the lady,<br>
and he who first gave you to me,<br>
from which source all our good was born, and she,<br>
before everything, dearer to me than him, light of my life,<br>
through whose being alive, living is sweet to me.<br>

<br>
<br>69. Odorous: To Rufus<br>
I’m not surprised as to why no girl desires<br>
to place her gentle thighs beneath you, Rufus,<br>
not if you were to weaken her with gifts<br>
of rarest dresses, the delights of clearest gems.<br>
A certain evil story wounds you: that they tell<br>
about you: that you’ve a wild goat under the armpits.<br>
Everyone hates that, no wonder: since it’s a truly<br>
evil-smelling beast, not one that girls bed with.<br>
So either kill the cruel plague to their noses,<br>
or cease to wonder why they run away.<br>

<br>
<br>70. Woman’s Faithfulness<br>
My girl says she’d rather marry no one but me,<br>
not if Jupiter himself were to ask her.<br>
She says: but what a girl says to her eager lover,<br>
should be written on the wind and in running water.<br>

<br>
<br>71. Revenge<br>
If a goat’s smell under the arms rightly prevents anyone,<br>
or if a slow gout deservedly cripples them,<br>
your rival, who keeps your lover busy,<br>
is discovered by you to be wonderfully sick with both.<br>
Now whenever he fucks her, you’re revenged on the pair:<br>
she’s troubled by the smell, he’s ruined by the gout.<br>

<br>
<br>72. Familiarity: to Lesbia<br>
Once you said you preferred Catullus alone,<br>
Lesbia: would not have Jupiter before me.<br>
I prized you then not like an ordinary lover,<br>
but as a father prizes his children, his family.<br>
Now I know you: so, though I burn more fiercely,<br>
yet you’re worth much less to me, and slighter.<br>
How is that, you ask? The pain of such love<br>
makes a lover love more, but like less.<br>

<br>
<br>73. Failed Friend<br>
Stop wanting to be kind to all and sundry,<br>
or believing someone can become good.<br>
All are ungrateful: being generous achieves nothing,<br>
rather it wearies even, and greatly harms:<br>
so with me, whom no one oppresses as heavily, bitterly,<br>
as he who once held me to be his one and only friend.<br>

<br>
<br>74. Security: to Gellius<br>
Gellius had heard his uncle used to rebuke,<br>
anyone who performed or spoke about love’s delights.<br>
To avoid this misfortune himself, he seduced<br>
his uncle’s wife, and made his uncle a silent Harpocrates.<br>
What he wanted, he did: for, now though he buggered<br>
his uncle himself, his uncle would not say a word.<br>

<br>
<br>75. Chained: to Lesbia<br>
My mind’s reduced to this, by your faults, Lesbia,<br>
and has ruined itself so in your service,<br>
that now it couldn’t wish you well,<br>
were you to become what’s best,<br>
or stop loving you if you do what’s worst.<br>

<br>
<br>76. Past Kindness: to the Gods<br>
If recalling past good deeds is pleasant to a man,<br>
when he thinks himself to have been virtuous,<br>
not violating sacred ties, nor using the names of gods<br>
in any contract in order to deceive men,<br>
then there are many pleasures left to you, Catullus,<br>
in the rest of life, due to this thankless passion.<br>
Since whatever good a man can do or say<br>
to anyone, has been said and done by you.<br>
All, that entrusted to a thankless heart is lost.<br>
Why torment yourself then any longer?<br>
Why not harden your mind, and shrink from it,<br>
and cease to be unhappy, since the gods are hostile?<br>
It’s difficult to suddenly let go of a former love,<br>
it’s difficult, but it would gratify you to do it:<br>
That’s your one salvation. That’s for you to prove,<br>
for you to try, whether you can or not.<br>
O gods, if mercy is yours, or if you ever brought help<br>
to a man at the very moment of his death,<br>
gaze at my pain and, if I’ve lived purely,<br>
lift this plague, this destruction from me,<br>
so that the torpor that creeps into my body’s depths<br>
drives out every joy from my heart.<br>
I no longer ask that she loves me to my face,<br>
or, the impossible, that she be chaste:<br>
I choose health, and to rid myself of this foul illness.<br>
O gods, grant me this for all my kindness.<br>

<br>
<br>77. Traitor: to Rufus<br>
Rufus, trusted by me as a friend, uselessly and pointlessly,<br>
(Uselessly? Rather, at a great and evil price),<br>
have you crept into my life like this, and ruptured<br>
my entrails, ah alas, have you robbed me of all my good?<br>
You’ve robbed me, oh cruel poison of my life,<br>
oh ruin of my friendship.<br>

<br>
<br>78. The Pandar: to Gallus<br>
Gallus has brothers, of whom one has the loveliest wife<br>
the other the loveliest son.<br>
Gallus is a cute man: since he joins them as lovers,<br>
so that beautiful boy beds with beautiful girl.<br>
Gallus is a stupid man, not seeing himself as a husband,<br>
who instructs a nephew in an uncle’s wife’s adultery.<br>

<br>
<br>78b. Immortality<br>
But now I grieve that your foul saliva<br>
has polluted the pure lips of a pure girl.<br>
Still you’ll not do it with impunity: now all the years<br>
will know you, and ancient tradition tell what you are.<br>

<br>
<br>79. Not So Fair: to Lesbius<br>
Lesbius is pretty. Why not? Since Lesbia likes him<br>
more than you and all your people, Catullus.<br>
But still let this pretty boy sell Catullus and all his people<br>
if he should find three to acknowledge his birth.<br>

<br>
<br>80. Give-Away: to Gellius<br>
What can I say, Gellius, as to why those red lips<br>
become whiter than winter snow,<br>
when you leave your house in the morning or when<br>
the eighth hour wakes you placid and weak in the long day?<br>
It’s something, for sure: perhaps rumour’s whisper is true<br>
that you swallow the tall jet from a man’s groin?<br>
this is for sure: Victor’s strained thighs proclaim it,<br>
and your lips marked with dried semen.<br>

<br>
<br>81. Strange Taste: to Iuventius<br>
Can there be no one in all these people, Iuventius,<br>
no nice man you might begin to like,<br>
besides that guest of yours, yellower than a gilded statue,<br>
from the environs of deadly Pesaro,<br>
who pleases you now, whom you dare to prefer<br>
to me, and do who knows what with?<br>

<br>
<br>82. Eye-debt: to Quintius<br>
Quintius, if you want Catullus to owe you his eyes<br>
or something that might be more dear than his eyes,<br>
don’t steal from him what’s much dearer to him<br>
than his eyes, or something dearer than eyes.<br>

<br>
<br>83. The Husband: to Lesbia<br>
Lesbia says bad things about me to her husband’s face:<br>
it’s the greatest delight to that fool.<br>
Mule, don’t you see? If she forgot and was silent about me,<br>
that would be right: now since she moans and abuses,<br>
she not only remembers, but something more serious,<br>
she’s angry. That is, she’s inflamed, so she speaks.<br>

<br>
<br>84. Aspirations: to Arrius<br>
Arrius said chonvenient when he meant to say<br>
convenient, and ambush was hambush,<br>
and trusted he’d spoken amazingly well,<br>
when he’d said hambush as much as he could.<br>
So, I guess, his mother and uncle spoke, freely,<br>
so his maternal grandfather, grandmother.<br>
When he was posted to Syria our ears had a rest,<br>
they heard the same things said softly and easily,<br>
nor feared to hear such words in future,<br>
when suddenly terrible news is brought,<br>
the Ionian Sea, since Arrius got there,<br>
is not Ionian now, but Hionian.<br>

<br>
<br>85. Love-Hate<br>
I hate and love. And why, perhaps you’ll ask.<br>
I don’t know: but I feel, and I’m tormented.<br>

<br>86. True Beauty: to Lesbia<br>
Quintia’s lovely to many. To me she’s white, long,<br>
and straight: I acknowledge that’s so.<br>
But I don’t agree that’s beauty: there’s no charm,<br>
there’s not a speck of good taste in all of that long body.<br>
Lesbia’s lovely, possessed of all that’s most beautiful,<br>
besides she alone’s stolen all charm from all other women.<br>

<br>
<br>87. Incomparable: to Lesbia<br>
No woman can say she’s been loved so much,<br>
as my Lesbia in truth’s been loved by me.<br>
No faith in any tie was ever so great,<br>
as has been found, on my part, in love of you.<br>

<br>
<br>88. Incest in the Family: to Gellius<br>
What’s he doing, Gellius, the man who wantons<br>
with mother and sister, up all night, with no clothes on?<br>
What’s he doing, who won’t let his uncle play husband?<br>
Do you know how much sin any man might incur?<br>
O Gellius, he incurs so much not furthest Tethys<br>
can wash it away, nor Ocean begetter of Nymphs:<br>
since there’s no sin at all that exists beyond that one,<br>
not if he bent his head, and swallowed himself.<br>

<br>
<br>89. Thinness: to Gellius<br>
Gellius is thin: why wouldn’t he be? Whose mother enjoys life,<br>
so kind and so healthy, and a sister so charming,<br>
and so kind an uncle, and everywhere filled so with<br>
girls who’re related, why should he leave off being lean?<br>
Though he touched nothing, but what it’s illegal to touch,<br>
you’d find any number of reasons why he’d be lean.<br>

<br>
<br>90. Too Much! : to Gellius<br>
Let a Magus be born from the sinful union<br>
of Gellius and his mother, and learn Persian soothsaying:<br>
since a Magus ought to be born from a mother and son,<br>
if the impious religion of the Persians is true,<br>
so with acceptable chants he’ll pleasingly worship the gods<br>
melting the entrails in the greasy flame.<br>

<br>
<br>91. My Mistake: to Gellius<br>
It’s not because I knew you well or thought you faithful,<br>
Gellius, or thought you could keep your mind from vile sin,<br>
that I expected you to be true to me<br>
in this hopeless ruinous love of mine:<br>
but because I was aware that she, for whom a vast desire<br>
consumes me, was no mother or sister of yours.<br>
And though I was closely linked to you by friendship,<br>
I didn’t think that was enough excuse for you.<br>
You considered it enough: there’s so much pleasure<br>
in every game to you, in which there’s any sin.<br>

<br>
<br>92. Sign of Love: to Lesbia<br>
Lesbia always speaks ill of me, never shuts up<br>
about me: damn me if she doesn’t love me.<br>
What’s the sign? Because it’s the same with me: I’m<br>
continually complaining, but damn me if I don’t love her.<br>

<br>
<br>93. Indifference: to Gaius Julius Caesar<br>
I’ve no great inclination to want to please you, Caesar,<br>
or to know which of the two you are, black or white.<br>

<br>94. Naturally: to Mentula<br>
Mentula the Cock fornicates. Does a Cock fuck? For sure.<br>
That’s what they say: the pot picks its own herbs.<br>

<br>
<br>95. Smyrna: to Gaius Helvius Cinna<br>
My Cinna’s Smyrna is published at last, nine<br>
summers and winters after it was begun,<br>
while from Hatria there’s half a million verses a year<br>
.....................................................<br>
.....................................................<br>
Smyrna, reaching the deep streams of Cyprian Satrachus,<br>
white-haired centuries will long read Smyrna.<br>
But Volusian annals will be stillborn in Padua,<br>
and often provide a limp wrapper for mackerel.<br>
Let my friend’s little monument be dear to me,<br>
and the masses delight in swollen Antimachus.<br>

<br>
<br>96. Beyond The Grave: to Gaius Licinius Calvus<br>
If anything from our grief, can reach beyond<br>
the mute grave, Calvus, and be pleasing and welcome,<br>
grief with which, in longing, we revive our lost loves,<br>
and weep for vanished friendships once known,<br>
surely Quintilia’s not so much sad for her early death,<br>
as joyful for your love.<br>

<br>
<br>97. Disgusting: to Aemilius<br>
I did not (may the gods love me) think it mattered,<br>
whether I might be smelling Aemilius’s mouth or arse.<br>
The one’s no cleaner, the other’s no dirtier,<br>
in fact his arse is both cleaner and nicer:<br>
since it’s no teeth. Indeed, the other has<br>
foot long teeth, gums like an old box-cart,<br>
and jaws that usually gape like the open<br>
cunt of a pissing mule on heat.<br>
He fucks lots of women, and makes himself out<br>
to be charming, and isn’t set to the mill with the ass?<br>
Shouldn’t we think, of any girl touching him,<br>
she’s capable of licking a foul hangman’s arse?<br>

<br>
<br>98. Well Armed: to Victius<br>
About you, if anyone, Stinking Victius, can be said<br>
what they say of the verbose and fatuous.<br>
With that tongue, if the need arose,<br>
you could lick arses, and leather-soled sandals.<br>
If you want to destroy us completely, Victius,<br>
gape at us: what you desire you’ll wholly achieve.<br>

<br>
<br>99. Stolen Kisses: to Iuventius<br>
I stole a sweet kiss while you played, sweet Iuventius,<br>
one sweeter than sweetest ambrosia.<br>
Not taken indeed with impunity: for more than an hour<br>
I remember, I hung at the top of the gallows,<br>
while I was justifying myself to you, yet with my tears<br>
I couldn’t lessen your anger a tiny morsel.<br>
No sooner was it done, than, your lips rinsed<br>
with plenty of water, you banished it with your fingers,<br>
so nothing contracted from my lips might remain,<br>
as though it were the foul spit of a tainted whore.<br>
More, you handed me unhappily to vicious love<br>
who’s not failed to torment me in every way,<br>
so that sweet kiss, altered for me from ambrosia,<br>
was more bitter than bitter hellebore then.<br>
Since you lay down such punishments for unhappy love,<br>
now, after this, I’ll never steal kisses again.<br>

<br>100. A Choice: to Marcus Caelius<br>
Caelius with Aufilenus, and Quintius with Aufilena,<br>
both madly in love with the brother, the sister,<br>
the flower of Veronese youth. That as they say’s<br>
truly sweet, that fellowship of brothers.<br>
Who shall I favour more? You, Caelius, since<br>
your friendship, alone, saw me through my passion,<br>
when the furious flames scorched me to the core.<br>
Be happy, Caelius, be successful in love.<br>

<br>101. Ave Atque Vale: An Offering to the Dead<br>
Carried over many seas, and through many nations,<br>
brother, I come to these sad funeral rites,<br>
to grant you the last gifts to the dead,<br>
and speak in vain to your mute ashes.<br>
Seeing that fate has stolen from me your very self.<br>
Ah alas, my brother, taken shamefully from me,<br>
yet, by the ancient custom of our parents,<br>
receive these sad gifts, offerings to the dead,<br>
soaked deeply with a brother’s tears,<br>
and for eternity, brother: ‘Hail and Farewell!’<br>

<br>
<br>102. Secrecy: to Cornelius<br>
If anything was ever entrusted by a friend to a silent<br>
sure one, whose loyalty of spirit is deeply known,<br>
you’ll find I’m equally bound by that sacred rite,<br>
Cornelius, and turned into a pure Harpocrates.<br>

<br>103. Choose: to Silo<br>
Silo, please return the ten sestertii,<br>
and then be as wild and unruly as you like:<br>
or, if you like the money, please leave off<br>
being a pander, and wild and unruly too.<br>

<br>
<br>104. Monstrous<br>
Do you think I could speak ill of my own life,<br>
she who’s dearer to me than my two eyes?<br>
I couldn’t, nor, if I could, would I love so desperately:<br>
but you, with Tappo, you do everything monstrous.<br>

<br>105. No Poet: to Mentula<br>
Mentula the Cock tries to climb the Parnassian Mount:<br>
the Muses with pitchforks toss him out, head first.<br>

<br>106. It’s Obvious<br>
When you see one who’s an auctioneer with a pretty boy,<br>
what to think, but that he wants to advertise himself?<br>

<br>107. Back Again: to Lesbia<br>
If anything happens to one who desires it, and wishes<br>
and never expects it, it’s a special delight to the mind.<br>
Likewise, this is delight, dearer than gold, to me,<br>
that you come back to me, Lesbia, in my longing.<br>
come back, desired and un-hoped for, give yourself<br>
back to me. O day marked out with greater brightness!<br>
Who exists more happily than me, or can say<br>
that he wishes for any life greater than this?<br>

<br>
<br>108. Dear Cominius<br>
If your white-haired old age, soiled by your impure ways,<br>
is ended by will of the people, Cominius,<br>
I’ve no doubt, for my part, your tongue, first, the enemy<br>
of good, will be cut out, and given to eager vultures,<br>
your eyes gouged out, swallowed by black-throated ravens,<br>
your intestines by dogs, the rest of your body by wolves.<br>

<br>
<br>109. A Prayer: to Lesbia<br>
You declare that this love of ours will be happy,<br>
mea vita, and eternal between us.<br>
Great gods, let it be that she promises truthfully,<br>
and says it sincerely, and from her heart,<br>
so we may extend, through the whole of our life,<br>
this endless bond of sacred friendship.<br>

<br>
<br>110. No Cheating: to Aufilena<br>
Aufilena, just mistresses are always praised:<br>
they accept their reward, for what they agree to.<br>
You, who promised, dishonestly hostile, to me,<br>
who don’t give but just take, you do wrong.<br>
To carry it through would be fine, Aufilena,<br>
not to promise is chaste: but to snatch at what’s given<br>
in fraudulent service, is worse than the greediest whore<br>
who offers herself with her whole body.<br>

<br>
<br>111. Preferable: to Aufilena<br>
To live content with one man, Aufilena,<br>
is the glory of highest glories for a bride:<br>
but its better to sleep with whoever she likes,<br>
than be mother of her cousins by her uncle.<br>

<br>
<br>112. To Naso<br>
You’re a lot of man, Naso, but lots of men<br>
wouldn’t stoop to you: Naso, a lot of man and a pathic.<br>

<br>
<br>113. Fruitful: to Gaius Helvius Cinna<br>
In Pompey’s first Consulate two men frequented Maecilia,<br>
Cinna: now he is Consul again<br>
those two remain, but each one’s increased by a thousand.<br>
The fruitful seed of adultery.<br>

<br>
<br>114. Mirage: to Mentula<br>
They say, no lie, that Mentula the Cock is rich<br>
with the pastures of Firmum, full of good things,<br>
fowling of every kind, fish, meadows, fields and game.<br>
In vain: his income’s surpassed by his costs.<br>
So, I concede he’s rich, while everything’s lacking.<br>
lets praise the pastures, so long as he’s in want.<br>

<br>115. Menace: to Mentula<br>
Mentula’s good for thirty acres of meadows,<br>
forty of fields: the rest of it’s marsh.<br>
Why shouldn’t he exceed Croesus in riches,<br>
one who possesses so many assets, in land,<br>
meadows, fields, vast woods and pastures and pools<br>
as far as the Hyperboreans, and Ocean’s seas?<br>
All this is great, but he’s the greatest of all,<br>
not a man, but, in truth, a great projecting Cock.<br>

<br>
<br>116. The Last Word: to Gellius<br>
I’ve often been searching around, my busy mind hunting,<br>
as to how I could send you Callimachus’s poems,<br>
so they’d soften you towards me, so you’d not try<br>
to land your hostile shafts on my head,<br>
now I see I’ve troubled myself in vain,<br>
Gellius, my good intentions were worthless.<br>
I’ll evade the shafts of yours you fire at me,<br>
but you’ll be punished, fixed for ever by mine.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>Index of First Lines<br>
To whom do I send this fresh little book<br>
Sparrow, my sweet girl’s delight,<br>
It’s as pleasing to me as, they say,<br>
Mourn, O you Loves and Cupids<br>
This boat you see, friends, will tell you<br>
Let us live, my Lesbia, let us love,<br>
Flavius, unless your delights<br>
Lesbia, you ask how many kisses of yours<br>
Sad Catullus, stop playing the fool,<br>
Veranius, first to me of all<br>
Varus drags me into his affairs<br>
Furius and Aurelius, you friends of Catullus,<br>
Asinius Marrucinus, you don’t employ<br>
You’ll dine well, in a few days, with me,<br>
If I didn’t love you more than my eyes,<br>
I commend myself and my love to you,<br>
I’ll fuck you and bugger you,<br>
O Cologna, who want a long bridge to sport on,<br>
Aurelius, father of hungers,<br>
Varus, that Suffenus, thoroughly known to us,<br>
Furius, you who’ve neither slaves nor cash<br>
Iuventius, who are our pride,<br>
Thallus the sodomite, softer than rabbit’s fur<br>
Furius, your little villa’s not exposed<br>
Serving-boy fill for me stronger cups<br>
Followers of Piso, needy retinue,<br>
Who could see it, who could endure it,<br>
Alfenus, negligent, false to the concord of pals,<br>
Sirmio, jewel of islands, jewel of peninsulas,<br>
Please, my sweet Ipsíthilla,<br>
O first of the bath-house thieves<br>
Under Diana’s protection,<br>
Paper, I’d like you to say to Caecilius,<br>
Annals, of Volusius, papyrus droppings,<br>
Lecherous tavern, and you its regulars,<br>
He’s ill, Cornificius, your Catullus,<br>
Egnatius, because he has snow-white teeth,<br>
What illness of mind, poor little Ravidus,<br>
Ameana, a girl fucked by all,<br>
Come, hendecasyllables, all that there are<br>
Greetings, girl with a nose not the shortest,<br>
O my estate, whether you’re Sabine or Tiburtine<br>
Septimius holding his beloved Acme<br>
Now Spring returns mild and temperate,<br>
Porcius and Socration, two left hands<br>
Iuventius, if I were always allowed<br>
Most fluent of Romulus’s descendants,<br>
Yesterday, Calvus, idle day<br>
He seems equal to the gods, to me, that man,<br>
Why, Catullus? Why wait to die?<br>
I laughed when someone, from the crowd,<br>
Otho’s head is quite tiny,<br>
I beg you, if it’s not too much trouble,<br>
O Cato, an amusing ridiculous thing,<br>
Beautifully matched the perverse buggers,<br>
Caelius, our Lesbia, that Lesbia,<br>
Rufa from Bologna gives head to Rufulus,<br>
You now, did a lioness, from African mountains,<br>
You, who live on Helicon’s<br>
Evening is here, young men, arise: evening, awaited<br>
As soon as Attis, borne over the deep seas in a swift boat,<br>
Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion<br>
Though I’m continually worn out by grief’s pain,<br>
He who gazed at all the lights in the vast heavens,<br>
O hail, sweet door, pleasing to a husband, pleasing<br>
That you send this letter to me, written with tears,<br>
I can’t conceal, goddesses, the things of mine<br>
I’m not surprised as to why no girl desires<br>
My girl says she’d rather marry no one but me,<br>
If a goat’s smell under the arms rightly prevents anyone,<br>
Once you said you preferred Catullus alone,<br>
Stop wanting to be kind to all and sundry,<br>
Gellius had heard his uncle used to rebuke,<br>
My mind’s reduced to this, by your faults, Lesbia,<br>
Rufus, trusted by me as a friend, uselessly and pointlessly,<br>
Gallus has brothers, of whom one has the loveliest wife<br>
But now I grieve that your foul saliva<br>
What can I say, Gellius, as to why those red lips<br>
Can there be no one in all these people, Iuventius,<br>
Quintius, if you want Catullus to owe you his eyes<br>
Lesbia says bad things about me to her husband’s face:<br>
Arrius said chonvenient when he meant to say<br>
Quintia’s lovely to many. To me she’s white, long,<br>
No woman can say she’s been loved so much,<br>
What’s he doing, Gellius, the man who wantons<br>
Let a Magus be born from the sinful union<br>
It’s not because I knew you well or thought you faithful,<br>
Lesbia always speaks ill of me, never shuts up<br>
I’ve no great inclination to want to please you, Caesar,<br>
Mentula the Cock fornicates. Does a Cock fuck? For sure.<br>
My Cinna’s Smyrna is published at last, nine<br>
If anything from our grief, can reach beyond<br>
I did not (may the gods love me) think it mattered,<br>
About you, if anyone, Stinking Victius, can be said<br>
I stole a sweet kiss while you played, sweet Iuventius,<br>
Caelius with Aufilenus, and Quintius with Aufilena,<br>
Carried over many seas, and through many nations,<br>
If anything was ever entrusted by a friend to a silent<br>
Silo, please return the ten sestertii,<br>
Do you think I could speak ill of my own life,<br>
Mentula the Cock tries to climb the Parnassian Mount:<br>
When you see one who’s an auctioneer with a pretty boy,<br>
If your white-haired old age, soiled by your impure ways,<br>
Aufilena, just mistresses are always praised:<br>
To live content with one man, Aufilena,<br>
You’re a lot of man, Naso, but lots of men<br>
In Pompey’s first Consulate two men frequented Maecilia,<br>
They say, no lie, that Mentula the Cock is rich<br>
Mentula’s as good as thirty acres of meadows,<br>
I’ve often been searching around, my busy mind hunting,<br>
